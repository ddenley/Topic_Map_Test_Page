A resistive DAC (R-DAC) is widely used for its intrinsic low flicker noise. However, the design of a high PSRR and low flicker noise reference generator for R-DAC not only consumes extra power and area with an external RC filter [1] but also limits the peak SNDR performance [2]. In contrast, a current-steering DAC (I-DAC) has intrinsic PSRR. In addition, the use of a tri-level implementation with a dumped buffer reduces noise with a small input signal, which improves dynamic range (DR), but flicker noise from the bias circuit still limits the peak SNR of the ADC. Instead of using large-sized transistors or an off-chip RC filter for required low flicker noise, the sample-and-hold noise filter [3] is proposed for a low noise I-DAC by filtering the bias noise with an off-transistor-based filter, which requires periodic refreshing to compensate the bias voltage drift due to the gate-leakage current of the DAC cells. However, a trade-off between bias voltage drift and folded sampling noise of this technique limits its usage in more advanced technology because larger gate-leakage current is expected. In order to solve aforementioned problems, we introduce a CT-DSM ADC with a gate-leakage compensated off-transistor (GLCOT) based I-DAC bias noise filter without extra off-chip components which is suitable for true wireless stereo (TWS) applications.

To achieve both a large bandwidth and high dynamic range with a 1 b    modulator, a high OSR and multi-GHz-rate sampling frequency are required. But there is a limit to the maximum sampling frequency of a    modulator, being a negative feedback system, in order to maintain loop stability and sufficiently low metastability, for a given technology node. To date, the maximum achievable bandwidth of a high-resolution 1 b    modulator is limited to a few tens of MHz. To achieve a bandwidth exceeding 100MHz with a single-loop    modulator, multi-bit quantization is essential [3][5]. When employing multi-bit quantization, the inherently linear property of a 1b DAC that consists of only a single unit element is lost, due to processing imperfections that cause mismatch errors between the multiple unit elements of a multi-bit DAC. The impact of static and dynamic mismatch errors can be effectively reduced with calibration, dynamic matching and analog\/digital compensation techniques. State-of-the-art ADCs with bandwidths exceeding 100MHz have reported excellent linearity numbers up to 83dBc THD [4][5], but this is far off from the <-100dBc THD achieved by the ultra-highly linear 1b ADCs.

As impressive as these bandwidths are for CT ADCs, the required ADC architectures are complex, are sensitive to layout parasitics due to the high sampling rates, and most important of all, are power hungry, consuming several hundreds of mW. In this paper, we propose a filtering rnulti-stage noise-shaping (MASH)  ADC architecture that overcomes the abovementioned drawbacks. Passive delay compensating filters [4] are used to realize broadband and deep suppression of the input signal component at the internal filter nodes of the ADC. As a result, no interstage DACs are needed, which are commonly required to generate the quantization error replicas in a MASH  ADC, saving substantial power and greatly reducing the parasitic load of the high-speed critical nodes. Moreover, because of the absence of signal content at the internal filter nodes, the backend stages of the MASH architecture have relaxed linearity requirements and can be implemented with simple low-power Gm-C filters. Precise excess loop delay and excess phase compensation are accomplished with a partly resistive and capacitive stabilization DAC, enabling very-high-speed operation of the  loops.

This is particularly troublesome when the input to the CTDSM consists of large out-of-band interferers; handling them without saturating the quantizer needs larger inband DR, leading to increased power dissipation. A solution to this problem is to use a filter upfront to attenuate interferers. Alternatively [1], the filter can be moved into the CTDSM loop. In [1], a 1 st -order RC filter was used to tame the STF peak of a cascade of integrators with feedforward summation (CIFF) DSM. Apart from the limited selectivity offered by a 1 st -order filter, an active feedback path was necessary to stabilize the loop. The CTDSM in our work obtains an STF with a sharper transition band and a lower cutoff frequency (normalized to the desired signal bandwidth) compared to [1], with the aim of more effectively attenuating close-in interferers. This is realized by embedding a 2 nd -order active filter into the CTDSM. We show that this has the same functionality as the filter upfront, but achieves better linearity (for the same noise and power dissipation) when compared to the filter-CTDSM cascade. Further, no extra active circuitry is necessary to stabilize the loop. Measurements of a CTDSM (signal BW=2MHz), with a built-in VGA (0 to 18dB) and a 2 nd -order Butterworth filter (4MHz cutoff), show that the out-of-band IIP3 improves by about 10dB when compared to the CTDSM with the filter placed upfront.

The DPA consists of arrays of small sub-PAs that are digitally controlled to modulate the output amplitude, thus operating as an RF-DAC [1-6]. DPAs are normally designed in a switched mode (Classes E\/D\/D -1 , etc.) to achieve high efficiency while using high sampling rate to attenuate and push the spectral images to higher frequencies. However, they suffer from high nonlinearity in their AM-code-word (ACW) to AM and ACW-to-PM conversion. To correct for such nonlinearities, digital pre-distortion (DPD) of the input signal is often used [1-3], typically implemented by look-up tables (LUT). Unfortunately, DPD approaches suffer from large signal-BW expansion due to their inherently nonlinear characteristics. This, combined with the already present BW regrowth in a polar TX in the AM and PM paths, yields significant hardware-speed\/power constraints when the signal BW becomes large. For a Cartesian TX, the use of LUT-DPD is even more complicated since a full 2D LUT is typically required [2]. To relax the overall system complexity, it is highly desirable to have a PA with a maximum inherent linearity without compromising its power or efficiency. In this work, an ACW-AM correction based on nonlinear sizing along with controlling the peak voltage of RF clocks (overdrive voltage tuning) and a ACW-PM correction based on multiphase RF clocking are introduced to linearize the characteristic curves of a Class-E polar DPA with intent to avoid any kind of pre-distortion.","source":"ISSCC","title":"17.5 An intrinsically linear wideband digital polar PA featuring AM-AM and AM-PM corrections through nonlinear sizing, overdrive-voltage control, and multiphase RF clocking"}},{"docId":"3432","weight":0.34990566654241834,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Three major distortion sources in high-fidelity audio decoders are 1) DAC inter-symbol interference (ISI) [1], [2]; 2) 3 rd -order harmonic distortion (HD3) due to the 2 nd -order nonlinearity of poly resistors; and 3) Cross-over distortion (COD) arising from limited amplifier inner-loop gain due to high output load capacitance (C L ) [3], [4]. First, to alleviate the ISI, [1] presents a Real-Time Dynamic-Element-Matching (RT-DEM) algorithm to realize mismatch shaping for DAC cells, achieving 115dB SFDR without complex digital hardware as in [2]. However, the constraint of 1-LSB change with the RT-DEM limits dynamic range (DR) of the    modulator. Moreover, a high clock rate of 181 MHz causes a high power consumption. Second, with a large signal swing, the total harmonic distortion (THD) of current-to-voltage (I2V) amplifiers is frequently dominated by the HD3 in [1][5]. The potential cause of this HD3 is due to the velocity saturation effect (VSE) of poly resistors [6]. Lastly, for a large load capacitance, the damping-factor-control frequency compensation (DFCFC) is commonly applied in multi-stage amplifiers to enhance the stability [4], [5]. However, it degrades the amplifier inner-loop gain and causes severe COD. In [4], a compensation scheme inserts a gain stage inside the inner loop to boost the loop gain over the audio band (20Hz to 20kHz), suppressing the peak COD below 111 dBc. In this work, three techniques are presented to eliminate the aforementioned distortion sources: 1) a code-change-insensitive RT-DEM (CCI-RT-DEM) algorithm is introduced to dynamically select the new start index of rotated DAC cells for the next code, instead of the fixed index at the first one [1], thus allowing for more than 1-LSB change; 2) a poly-resistor linearization scheme is presented to suppress HD3 by mitigating the VSE of resistors; and 3) a 2nd-order DFCFC for multi-stage amplifiers is introduced that allows a high inner-loop gain to suppress the COD, thus enhancing the amplifier linearity even with a large C L .

Depending on operating conditions, this requires high in-band dynamic range and\/or low noise floor at specific out-of-band (OOB) frequencies, e.g. the receiver band of an FDD system or radio coexistence. For a transmitter to implement instantaneous bandwidth covering all communication bands while maintaining sufficient dynamic range is usually not cost efficient, and a direct-digital RF modulator (DDRM) with tunable operational band is a potential solution, providing better implementation tradeoff [1]-[4]. However, a conventional DDRM typically incurs an overhead of RF bandpass filtering for signal reconstruction and noise\/spur suppression due to the lack of a baseband reconstruction filter between the DAC and mixer. To relax the filter requirement, a bandpass delta-sigma modulator (DSM) [1] is used to create spectral notches for suppressing OOB noise with a limited in-band dynamic range. Recently, a time-approximation-filter (TAF) technique [2] was used to embed a reconstruction filter in the frequency upconversion process. Essentially, this approximates an FIR filter response in the time domain by pulse-width modulation of the LO waveform. While a TAF provides certain reconfigurability in filter response, the time resolution requirement of the modulated LO waveform increases with the approximation accuracy of the target filter response and likely demands a higher system clock rate.","source":"ISSCC","title":"10.2 A SAW-Less Direct-Digital RF Modulator with Tri-Level Time-Approximation Filter and Reconfigurable Dual-Band Delta-Sigma Modulation"}},{"docId":"2204","weight":0.10023098455416996,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Beamforming phased-array receivers aim to increase receiver sensitivity and reject interferers in the spatial domain [1,2].

Currently, halfduplex links based on TDD (preferred for IAB), FDD, spatial, and polarization-duplex are explored, targeting mm-wave TX\/RX isolation at the cost of channel capacity. While mmwave in-band full-duplex (IBFD) with shared antenna (ANT) interface can enable spectrum reuse in IAB and repeaters\/relays, >100dB total self-interference cancellation (SIC) is required with up to 50dB of SIC in the mm-wave front-end [2].

A resistive DAC (R-DAC) is widely used for its intrinsic low flicker noise. However, the design of a high PSRR and low flicker noise reference generator for R-DAC not only consumes extra power and area with an external RC filter [1] but also limits the peak SNDR performance [2]. In contrast, a current-steering DAC (I-DAC) has intrinsic PSRR. In addition, the use of a tri-level implementation with a dumped buffer reduces noise with a small input signal, which improves dynamic range (DR), but flicker noise from the bias circuit still limits the peak SNR of the ADC. Instead of using large-sized transistors or an off-chip RC filter for required low flicker noise, the sample-and-hold noise filter [3] is proposed for a low noise I-DAC by filtering the bias noise with an off-transistor-based filter, which requires periodic refreshing to compensate the bias voltage drift due to the gate-leakage current of the DAC cells. However, a trade-off between bias voltage drift and folded sampling noise of this technique limits its usage in more advanced technology because larger gate-leakage current is expected. In order to solve aforementioned problems, we introduce a CT-DSM ADC with a gate-leakage compensated off-transistor (GLCOT) based I-DAC bias noise filter without extra off-chip components which is suitable for true wireless stereo (TWS) applications.

To date, the maximum achievable bandwidth of a high-resolution 1 b    modulator is limited to a few tens of MHz. To achieve a bandwidth exceeding 100MHz with a single-loop    modulator, multi-bit quantization is essential [3][5]. When employing multi-bit quantization, the inherently linear property of a 1b DAC that consists of only a single unit element is lost, due to processing imperfections that cause mismatch errors between the multiple unit elements of a multi-bit DAC. The impact of static and dynamic mismatch errors can be effectively reduced with calibration, dynamic matching and analog\/digital compensation techniques.

In addition, since the small satellites cannot have the large-size antenna installed on the main body, a deployable membrane is attached to the main body for the large phased-array antenna.

This is particularly troublesome when the input to the CTDSM consists of large out-of-band interferers; handling them without saturating the quantizer needs larger inband DR, leading to increased power dissipation. A solution to this problem is to use a filter upfront to attenuate interferers. Alternatively [1], the filter can be moved into the CTDSM loop. In [1], a 1 st -order RC filter was used to tame the STF peak of a cascade of integrators with feedforward summation (CIFF) DSM. Apart from the limited selectivity offered by a 1 st -order filter, an active feedback path was necessary to stabilize the loop. The CTDSM in our work obtains an STF with a sharper transition band and a lower cutoff frequency (normalized to the desired signal bandwidth) compared to [1], with the aim of more effectively attenuating close-in interferers. This is realized by embedding a 2 nd -order active filter into the CTDSM. We show that this has the same functionality as the filter upfront, but achieves better linearity (for the same noise and power dissipation) when compared to the filter-CTDSM cascade. Further, no extra active circuitry is necessary to stabilize the loop. Measurements of a CTDSM (signal BW=2MHz), with a built-in VGA (0 to 18dB) and a 2 nd -order Butterworth filter (4MHz cutoff), show that the out-of-band IIP3 improves by about 10dB when compared to the CTDSM with the filter placed upfront.

However, compared with analog phased-array and hybrid systems, due to the absence of any rejection for spatial in-band blockers, the  RX\/ADC  dynamic range and linearity should be high enough to prevent array saturation. Therefore, the use of self-steering spatial notch filters (SNFs) is necessary to aid the digital beamformers and reduce RX\/ADC power consumption while strong blockers exist. To address that, the sub-6GHz RXs in [1], [2] synthesize a baseband spatial notch impedance and translate it to RF by passive mixers. However, this technique cannot be directly applied at mm-wave frequencies as the impedance translational performance of the passive mixers degrades significantly. Hence, the mm-wave beamformer in [3] realizes a cascadable SNF at an intermediate frequency (IF). However, the front-end mm-wave components like mixers and phase shifters have to tolerate strong blockers, thus degrading RX linearity. Besides, it uses multiple IF buffers and VGAs for signal scaling and combining, which could be power-hungry if a similar method is adopted to realize a mm-wave SNF. To improve on those limitations, we propose a scalable SNF structure, which (1) suppresses the strongest in-band blocker at mm-wave frequencies, (2) supports N-input-N-output MIMOs, and (3) requires no active blocks except the phase shifters.

In practical situations, however, this TX performance is strongly affected by mutual coupling among the closely-spaced radiating elements in the phased-array antenna, yielding a beam-steering angle-dependent and time-varying loading or VSWR condition. Furthermore, 5G mm-wave systems typically employ spectrally efficient modulation schemes with high peak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs). This requirement demands the TX power amplifier (PA) to operate in power back-off (PBO), thus degrading its average efficiency. To alleviate this issue, outphasing or Doherty PAs (DPAs) can be adopted [1-4]. However, as depicted in Fig. 14.4.1 (Top left), these efficiency-enhancement techniques will worsen the output reflection coefficient of the PA ( PA ). Consequently, the unwanted element-to-element coupled signal reflects back to the antenna and will deteriorate the phased-array beam pattern and its TX linearity. A previously promoted solution for this antenna VSWR problem is load mismatch detection, followed by tuning of the output matching network (self-healing). However, this requires the use of a reconfigurable and inevitably lossy matching network [5]. Also, active load pulling [1] and using a reconfigurable series\/parallel DPA configuration [2] have been proposed to realize a VSWR resilient efficiency-enhanced TX.

To alleviate this, time-consuming and often unpredictable optimization of the floor plan, package, and PCB is required to maximize the isolation between the PA and VCO. Ultimately, this issue may prohibit the use of this architecture for many applications, leading to higher power consumption.

Rather than storing secret keys in memories, the information of a PUF is extracted through amplification of the physically uncontrollable process variations and therefore, can uniquely authenticate each die to counteract counterfeit, piracy or sabotage. Classically, PUF architectures have exploited process variations affecting transistor-level active device performances such as process-dependent gate delays and interconnect delays, SRAM and inverter maximum gain points, and ring oscillator frequencies [1]-[6]. While active device variations have been exploited to generate PUF signatures, they are susceptible to noise, external perturbations and aging. Since the resultant process variant responses are typically normally distributed, to spread the variance of the distribution and decrease the number of challenges near the unstable decision region, we propose a method to exploit passive variations within the chip in addition to active device variations. While lithographic variations in the smallest metal features may not influence the electrical performance drastically, their effects can be amplified at optical frequencies with wavelengths comparable to the minimal feature size. In fact, before the concept of electronic PUFs were demonstrated in silicon, one of the first implementations of strong PUFs was demonstrated in the optical domain, which exploited speckle-patterns of a random scattering medium in the presence of a laser light. In this work, we present the first CMOS-based opto-active PUF, which not only utilizes the active variations, but also amplifies the lithographic variation of passive metal structures through process-sensitive copper-based CMOS integrated photonic crystals.

Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) have drawn increasing attention as key security building blocks for authentication since each PUF circuit has unique challenge response pairs (CRPs). Such uniqueness is achieved by maximizing the effects of process variation using process-sensitive circuits, i.e. PUF cells. Recently reported PUF cell types include cells based on a two-transistor amplifier [1], NAND gate [2], ring oscillator [3], current mirror [4], back-to-back connected inverters [5], and inverter [6]. Regardless of the variation source, PUFs inevitably include CRPs that respond inconsistently when the process variation of the compared element in the CRP is small compared to noise. For example, if the output of a two-transistor amplifier in [1] is near the switching threshold, the output can be inconsistent, resulting in bit error and an unstable CRP. Thus, efforts have focused on stabilizing unstable CRPs. The most straightforward stabilization scheme is temporal majority voting (TMV) [1,5], but the improvement in bit error rate (BER) and stability is limited since it does not directly address the instability of a given CRP.

As the device-dependent radio impairments come from process variation, it is challenging for impersonators to forge in practice.

The master processor executes scalar instruction packets and issues vector instruction packets to the slave coprocessor. The vector coprocessor executes wide-data arithmetic and memory operations for significant processing at the cost of high power. The power delivery for a mobile system-on-chip (SoC) processor consists of a battery that drives a PMIC to generate the SoC supply voltage (V DD ) rails. The PMIC voltage regulator (VR) supplies V DD  while operating below a peak-current specification (spec). If the CDSP exceeds the peak-current spec for a sustained duration, then the battery and\/or PMIC VR may incur a brownout condition where V DD  degrades, resulting in circuit failures. Thus, the CDSP requires a current-limiting system to prevent brownout. The latency requirement to detect the current exceeding the peak-current spec and then to respond by operating at a lower current is 1s. Also, the SoC must operate within a target thermal design power and temperature with detection and response latencies in 100's of s and 10's of ms, respectively. Prior current- and temperature-limiting systems lower the phase-locked loop (PLL) clock frequency (F CLK ) or reduce V DD  and (F CLK ) in response to exceeding current or temperature specs. Although these techniques are effective for response latencies above 10s, the time to reduce the PLL F CLk  or V DD  and F CLK  far exceeds the 10s latency spec. Alternative approaches for satisfying the 1s latency target include integrating an adaptive clocking circuit after the PLL [4] or throttling the instruction-issue rate [5] to quickly change performance. These designs satisfy the latency spec by globally reducing performance without considering individual thread power or priority. This paper describes a thread-level power management (TPM) design to adapt the instruction-issue rate based on individual thread power and priority for a current- and temperature-limiting system in a 7nm [6] Hexagon CDSP. The TPM exploits low-power phases during thread execution to adjust the thread instruction-issue rate to achieve a higher performance at a target power as compared to global throttling.","source":"ISSCC","title":"35.3 Thread-Level Power Management for a Current- and Temperature-Limiting System in a 7nm Hexagon Processor"}},{"docId":"2039","weight":0.02390078076374804,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"With the dramatically increasing use of mobile and portable devices, the need for computation has intensified, motivating the transformation of traditional static services (Web and storage) to evolve toward distributed Web services, forming Cloud 1.0; in this process, the evolution into the Smart Device Era involved many changes: stationary computing devices are going mobile, standalone devices are becoming connected, and peer-to-peer communication (email) extending to many-to-many (social networking).

Low-power MCUs are widely used in these systems. For these applications, standby power, as well as active power, is important contributor to the total energy consumption because active sensing or computing phases are much shorter than the standby state. Figure 13.4.1 shows a typical power profile of low-power MCU applications. To achieve many years of battery lifetime, the power consumption of the chip must be kept below 1A during deep sleep mode. Another key feature of a low-power MCU for such applications is fast wake-up from deep-sleep mode, which is important for low application latency and to keep wake-up energy minimal. For fast wake-up, the system must retain its state and logged information during sleep mode because several-hundred microseconds are needed for reloading such data to memories. Conventional SRAM consumes much higher retention current than the required deep-sleep-mode current as shown in Fig. 13.4.1. Embedded Flash memories have limited write endurance on the order of 10 5  cycles making them difficult to use in applications that frequently power down. Embedded FRAM [1,2] has been used for this purpose and it could be used as a random-access memory as well as a nonvolatile memory. However, as a random-access memory, its slow operation and high energy consumption [1,2] limits performance of the MCU and battery lifetime. Furthermore, additional process steps for fabricating FRAM memory cells increase the cost of MCU. SRAM can operate at higher speed with lower energy without additional process steps, but high retention current makes it difficult to sustain data in deep-sleep mode. To solve this problem, we develop low-leakage current SRAM (XLL SRAM) that reduce retention current by 1000 compared to conventional SRAM and operate with less than 10ns access time. The retention current of XLL SRAM is negligible in the deep-sleep mode because it is much smaller than the amount of the deep-sleep-mode current of MCU, which is dominated by active current of the real-time clock and control logic circuits. By using XLL SRAM, the store and reload process during mode transitions can be eliminated and wake-up time from deep-sleep mode of MCU is reduced to few microseconds. This paper describes a 128kb SRAM with 3.5nA (27fA\/b) retention current, 7ns access time, and 25W\/MHz active energy consumption.

Recently, Ising machines based on quantum annealing [1] and CMOS technologies [2][5] have received growing interest as efficient hardware accelerators that could replace traditional computing hardware (CPUs and GPUs) for solving real-world COPs. An Ising model, a basis of the Ising machines, finds the optimal (or sub-optimal) solutions of the COPs by efficiently exploring a solution space based on its intrinsic convergence property towards the lower Ising Hamiltonian (or energy). Another critical enabler is the annealing process, which prevents the Ising machine from converging to local minimum solutions and increases the chance to find the global optimum. Existing Ising machines with fixed hardware topology based on simple graphs (e.g., King's graph [2] [4]) are ill-suited to a practical Ising model with arbitrary spin interactions. In contrast, a fully connected Ising machine [3] can map a wide range of Ising models, but at the cost of significant overheads in area, power consumption, and latency. A recent work [5] demonstrated a reconfigurable Ising machine that enables an arbitrary interaction between spins. However, it has a restricted number of interactions per spin (up to 8) due to the fixed hardware topology (King's graph), which only allows eight interactions.

Low-power MCUs are widely used in these systems. For these applications, standby power, as well as active power, is important contributor to the total energy consumption because active sensing or computing phases are much shorter than the standby state. Figure 13.4.1 shows a typical power profile of low-power MCU applications. To achieve many years of battery lifetime, the power consumption of the chip must be kept below 1A during deep sleep mode. Another key feature of a low-power MCU for such applications is fast wake-up from deep-sleep mode, which is important for low application latency and to keep wake-up energy minimal. For fast wake-up, the system must retain its state and logged information during sleep mode because several-hundred microseconds are needed for reloading such data to memories. Conventional SRAM consumes much higher retention current than the required deep-sleep-mode current as shown in Fig. 13.4.1. Embedded Flash memories have limited write endurance on the order of 10 5  cycles making them difficult to use in applications that frequently power down. Embedded FRAM [1,2] has been used for this purpose and it could be used as a random-access memory as well as a nonvolatile memory. However, as a random-access memory, its slow operation and high energy consumption [1,2] limits performance of the MCU and battery lifetime. Furthermore, additional process steps for fabricating FRAM memory cells increase the cost of MCU. SRAM can operate at higher speed with lower energy without additional process steps, but high retention current makes it difficult to sustain data in deep-sleep mode. To solve this problem, we develop low-leakage current SRAM (XLL SRAM) that reduce retention current by 1000 compared to conventional SRAM and operate with less than 10ns access time. The retention current of XLL SRAM is negligible in the deep-sleep mode because it is much smaller than the amount of the deep-sleep-mode current of MCU, which is dominated by active current of the real-time clock and control logic circuits. By using XLL SRAM, the store and reload process during mode transitions can be eliminated and wake-up time from deep-sleep mode of MCU is reduced to few microseconds. This paper describes a 128kb SRAM with 3.5nA (27fA\/b) retention current, 7ns access time, and 25W\/MHz active energy consumption. Its low retention current, high-speed, and low-power operation enable to activate SRAM in the deep-sleep mode, and also provides fast wake-up, low active energy consumption and high performance to MCU.","source":"ISSCC","title":"13.4 A 7ns-access-time 25W\/MHz 128kb SRAM for low-power fast wake-up MCU in 65nm CMOS with 27fA\/b retention current"}},{"docId":"2650","weight":0.038677914087091717,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"A two-transistor antifuse OTP memory macro using permanent MOS-gate-oxide breakdown as a programming scheme is fabricated and characterized.

In the previous distributed DLDOs [1 3], even though all LDO outputs are connected to drive the power-delivery network, the LDOs operate independently using their own controller, which occupies a large portion of the LDO size.

Such usage conditions usually cause  V_MIN  to depend on  V_IN , which translates into cost (test-time increase) and\/or power\/performance  (V_MIN  guard bands) penalties. In this paper, we report on a CPU-grade digital LDO (DLDO) that supports adequate (to CPU performance requirements) power densities and mitigates  V_MIN  dependency on the input voltage. The DLDO was implemented in a 10nm process node, as part of a multi-domain SOC. High-level power-plane partitioning is shown in Fig. 14.3.1 (top). Figure 14.3.1 (bottom) illustrates the high-level DLDO block scheme. The chosen architecture comprises a digital power stage and a digital controller for the following reasons: (a) digital design features weaker process dependency and better design convergence; (b) potentially higher  I_LOAD  and regulation BW (iso-area); and (c) better performance in low-DO  (dropout =V_IN -V_OUT_-TARGET )  conditions and easier transition to a bypass (BP) mode to enable lowest possible  V_IN  (e.g.,  V_IN  of 20mV leads to  P_IN  1 W for a 45W product). Some digital DLDO designs [13] feature a dual-loop architecture: a relatively-Iow-BW linear control and a high-BW, event-driven fast control (i.e. Non-Linear Control (NLC)). From an SOC standpoint, the disadvantage of the NLC is that its charge injection is DO dependent. The NLC efficiency drops with  V_IN  and depends on an SOC power scenario. It was decided to base the DLDO architecture on a linear-only controller, fast enough to cope with  I_LOAD  transients and minimizing the dependency of  V_OUT(t)  on  V_IN .

State-of-the-art LED drivers employ the SIMO topology with four channels in Fig. 12.7.1, to deliver energy to each LED using the time-multiplexing (TM) control technique [2-4], in which the luminance is controlled by the dimming signals. Two major shortcomings for such approaches are: (1) Sequential dimming signals; and (2) Current cross-regulation (CCR) effects. In [2], the LED drivers with TM control result in only 9b color resolution at the dimming frequency of 1.5kHz, which may cause flicker hazard. Besides, the complete white-red-green-blue (WRGB) sequence needs a total of four switching periods to light up the 4 LEDs separately. On the other hand, due to inherent rising and falling delay of the hysteretic current control (HCC) circuit, t dr  and t df  respectively, the CCR effect seriously affects the accuracy of the controller when the inductor current slope is varied. For example, with L=15H, V IN =20V, V R =2.5V, V G =3.5V, t dr =300ns and t df =250ns, the SIMO will result in 4 R , V G , V B , or V W , are different, large voltage cross-regulation (VCR) across the RSEN occurs and so does the CCR.

The power converter that drives the processor should have a wide output voltage range and fast reference-tracking response while maintaining a high efficiency. For such applications, inductive switching converters are suitable candidates [1-4]. To enhance the transient response and to reduce the size of off-chip components, DC-DC converters switching in the 10MHz range are studied recently. When switching at a high frequency, efficiency is compromised as the switching loss becomes significant. Moreover, comparator delay of a few ns causes serious over-charging and over-discharging of the ramp capacitor and the delay also limits the maximum duty cycle of the converter. A current-mode control needs an on-chip current sensor that would consume too much power when running in the 10MHz range. In [5], a 5MHz converter employs auto-selectable peak- and valley-current control, but the duty cycle range is limited to 0.6. A higher switching frequency (f s ) would further reduce this range and would not be applicable for DVS. Therefore, a voltage-mode control with Type-III compensation for loop bandwidth extension becomes an attractive solution. However, a conventional Type-III compensator needs large on-chip compensation capacitors and resistors. In [6], a pseudo Type-III compensator reduces the value and thus size of those components, however, it requires adding lowpass and bandpass functions that complicates the design, and furthermore it does not use any special technique for fast reference tracking.","source":"ISSCC","title":"4.4 A 10\/30MHz Wide-duty-cycle-range buck converter with DDA-based Type-III compensator and fast reference-tracking responses for DVS applications"}},{"docId":"3489","weight":0.025885907537977114,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"For more efficient power management in processors, a high-frequency and multi-phase (MP) integrated voltage regulator (IVR) using multiple inductors would be an ideal solution to deliver optimized power with rapid dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) [1][5]. Nevertheless, in practical use, MP-IVRs suffer from an inter-inductor current imbalance because of mismatches in integrated inductances, different parasitic resistances, and duty-control skews among all phases (top of Fig. 18.1.1). Such a current mismatch may cause larger output ripple and efficiency degradation, losing the benefits of multi-phase operation. Also, thermal hotspots can occur due to excessive current density and deteriorate reliability. Previous approaches [2], [4] use current sensors to calibrate the duty cycle of each phase, but the design complexity and power overhead tend to be greatly increased in the high-speed sensing circuitry for fast-switching converters. An additional consideration in MP-IVRs is the phase-shedding technique, which can improve the light-load efficiency by reducing the number of phases. In many prior works [1], [2], the number of phases was adjusted by 2N (e.g., 1-2-4) for simplicity of phase division. If the phase-shedding is more fine-grained, the overall efficiency can be more flattened over a wide range of loads. Moreover, because the frequency response and output ripple vary according to the number of phases, the MP-IVR should be adaptively optimized further for them.

For an N-phase converter, SR L  can be effectively increased by N times, at the expense of using N bulky inductors that increase both volume and cost. Hybrid schemes that comprise the parallel operation of the DC-DC converter and a linear regulator can improve the responses by injecting additional charging current (I ch ) without adding extra inductors.

These fast large steps incur large output voltage (V OUT ) droops, which induce failed paths and cause processor black-outs. Present voltage regulators (VRs) combat these challenges by using bulky output capacitor (C OUT ) arrays that could add up to over 100F. However, this practice is untenable for next-generation APs, which have severely limited PCB area and require fast dynamic voltage scaling. These challenges have led to great demand for ultra-fast VRs. PWM control requires a bandwidth 5 to 10 less than the switching frequency, f SW , which results in a slow response [1]. Hysteretic control has been proposed to achieve faster response [2, 3], however, it still suffers from an inherent delay (t delay ) up to the discharge period, (1-D)T, due to realistic hysteretic window size and inductor current (I L ) slew limit. Consider, for example, a fast hysteretic VR achieving 10 L  ripple <; 200mA, and C OUT  under a few F, t delay  cannot exceed a few ns. This requires a f SW  from 0.5 to 1GHz, which in turn causes a large switching loss and restricts the feasible power level of the converter. This is against the power demand trend of APs.

Wide-input-range integrated VRs, however have difficulty to simultaneously achieve high frequency (HF) operation and high power efficiency. Previous hard-switching (HS) high-input-voltage (HV) buck regulators can only operate at a low frequency of 100s of kHz in order to limit the dominant switching power loss PSW, that occurs at the converter switching node [1,2]. Low-frequency operation however results in using bulky inductors of 100s of H, significantly increasing the bill-of-material cost and the converter volume. Three-level converters (TLCs) are effective to reduce the required inductance by doubling the frequency at the switching node and allow using lower-voltage-rating power transistors in HV conditions. However, the concern of large PSW in HV conditions would still limit the HS TLC converter to operate in the MHz range. Moreover, the TLC needs the voltage across its flying capacitor to be balanced at half the input voltage; otherwise power transistors could be damaged during operation. In HF HV conditions, the capability of high-speed flying-capacitor self-balancing is even more crucial, but it is not addressed in prior 3-level DC-DC regulators [3,4].

However, the thermal issue becomes the limiting factor for fast charging an extremely compact portable device. How to move the heat out of the device, meanwhile keeping the device small and thin, becomes a question of great concern. An integrated charger involves a switching power converter, in which the power inductor is one of the main sources of power loss, besides occupying the largest area. To address this problem, an attractive solution is to relocate the power inductor in a DC-DC converter from the high-current output side to the low-current input side [13]. Such inductor-first topologies considerably reduce the average current on the inductor, and thus allowing the use of a smaller one. Furthermore, moving the inductor to the input side also allow the replacement of the discrete inductor by the parasitic inductor of the USB cable [1], eliminating the need for any magnetics on-board, and reducing the on-board power dissipation. Thus far, prior solutions still put the power converter chip inside the portable devices, which means the generated heat is still inside the device.

However, the cross-regulation and power consumption are two main issues of the previously reported SIMO converters [1-5]. Although pseudo-continuous conduction-mode (PCCM) control with a freewheel period [1] tries to augment power density and eliminate cross-regulation, associated power dissipation of freewheel switch exacerbates its overall efficiency.

The comparator-based controlled SIMO converters are investigated in [3, 4] and the cross-regulation in most channels is improved due to the fast response of the comparator.

Along with high efficiency, a DC-DC converter should provide quiet supply voltages for the display to avoid light fluctuation [1]. For this reason, many devices use two separate DC-DC converters, boost and inverting buck-boost converters, to generate a positive (V op ) and a negative (V on ) output voltage, respectively [2], as shown in top-left of Fig. 11.6.1.

By connecting the batteries in series, twice the charging power can be obtained with the same current. However, since the battery output voltage is high, a separate converter must be always working to supply the system power. Furthermore, the loss of the converter reduces the usable battery capacity. Also, there is a disadvantage in that a buck-boost switching charger [2], [3] is required to support a general adapter whose output voltage is not controllable. In a foldable phone, the battery capacity can be increased by mounting the battery under two screens. In that case, two batteries are generally connected in parallel as shown in Fig. 30.3.1, and each battery requires a charging current limiter. The traditional buck charger can be used as is, but there is a disadvantage in that the direct charging efficiency is lower than that of the serial battery system. The series-parallel battery system in Fig. 30.3.1 is a combination of the advantages of the series battery system and the parallel battery system.

This means fuel cells last longer with light loads and Li-ion batteries output more power across shorter periods.

Into the bargain, the USB Type-C interface with USB PD specification allows power delivery through a single port, which brings about the necessity for bi-directional power converter. To fulfill this task, one of the most common proposals is to implement two power converters for each direction, but this method will be costly to accomplish and will complicate the designs for controllers.

Double step-down (DSD, also known as series-capacitor) converters are among suitable candidates, as they provide 2 duty-cycle extension and 2 equivalent switching frequency with reduced voltage stress on power transistors by adding only one flying capacitor into a two-phase buck converter [1]. However, it is still challenging to robustly control a DSD converter to achieve fast transient responses. Hysteretic control is widely used in the buck converters for its simple structure and fast responses. However, it may not be feasible to apply hysteretic control to a DSD converter as the on times of the two phases must have 180 phase shift and cannot be overlapped. PWM control with fast Type-III compensation [2] is another attractive option, but it suffers from an inherent delay up to half of a switching period when responds to a load transient, as will be explained later. In [1], an adaptive on\/off time (AO2T) control approach is proposed to improve the responses by extending the on time during the transient. However, the 10 8.2s  is longer than 16 switching periods for a load step of only 1A and a complicated phase mirroring circuit is also needed. Moreover, as the operation principle of the DSD converter prevents the two phases from being turned on simultaneously, the benefit of doubling the slew rate of the inductor current which is taken advantage of by the two-phase buck converter disappears.","source":"ISSCC","title":"A 12V\/24V-to-1V DSD Power Converter with 56mV Droop and 0.9S1"}},{"docId":"677","weight":0.01965908114925948,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"A novel 3D InFO inductor is developed to integrate with TSMC 16nm FinFET devices for high efficiency integrated voltage regulator (IVR) design.

While SIMO converters in continuous conduction mode (CCM) can enable higher power with specialized circuits to reduce cross regulation [45], they are susceptible to random simultaneous load transients across multiple outputs that can disrupt a balanced inductor current waveform. On the other hand, isolating inductor in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) and separating each output's inductor cycle via an independent-charging scheme can effectively eliminate cross-regulation. However, large inductances with lower peak currents can limit output power [13] and low operating frequency in DCM can worsen droops due to longer wait times, thus necessitating larger output decoupling capacitors.","source":"ISSCC","title":"11.3 A 1.8W High-Frequency SIMO Converter Featuring Digital Sensor-Less Computational Zero-Current Operation and Non-Linear Duty-Boost"}},{"docId":"1680","weight":0.019520532431765002,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"This paper demonstrates a 200 V GaN-on-SOI smart power integrated circuits (ICs) platform developped on 200 mm substrates.

Switched-capacitor (SC) converters and buck converters are two common solutions. Unregulated SC converters can achieve high power density and high efficiency for specific voltage conversion ratios (VCRs). However, to cover wide input and output voltage ranges, they require a reconfigurable topology with multiple VCRs, thus increasing the system complexity. On the other hand, buck converters can reach a good efficiency over a wide continuous VCR range. Yet, they need a bulky inductor, which significantly degrades the power density. To address the power density and efficiency tradeoff, hybrid converters composed of both inductor and capacitor are among popular solutions [1  4]. When compared with the traditional buck converter, these hybrid converters feature lower voltage swing (smaller current ripple) of the inductor, higher switching frequency, and a larger duty cycle (D) for the same VCR, alleviating the requirements on the inductor, and resulting in higher power density. Nevertheless, as all the output current I OUT  goes through the inductor, this implies a large volume for small DCR and conduction loss  P_COND _ L . Recently, hybrid converters with reduced inductor current I L  have emerged [5  7]. In these hybrid converters, the SC not only lowers down the voltage of the switch node, but also offers another current path to the output, reducing the inductor current. In this work, we propose an SC-parallel-inductor buck topology (which we refer to as CPL-Buck since in the proposd structure there is a capacitor that is always in parallel with the inductor) that can further reduce \/ L  to less than 0.5I OUT , meaning a P COND _ L  reduction of over 75 OUT , 3-to-4.2V input to 0.6-to-1V output, the proposed CPL-Buck obtains a peak efficiency of 92.9 2  with a power inductor as small as 1.60.80.8mm 3 .","source":"ISSCC","title":"A Battery-Input Sub-1V Output 92.9"}},{"docId":"3645","weight":0.01935404186939088,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"A high-efficiency  12V  -input  1V-1.8V  -output DC-DC converter with wide output current range is highly desirable in energy-efficient portable devices (e.g., laptops) and automotive applications.

Both industry and academia have developed many hybrid DC-DC converter topologies to overcome these problems [16]. The double step-down (DSD) converter, shown in Fig. 11.10.1 (top right), is the most popular solution [24] for this application.  In  the DSD converter, the flying capacitor  C_F  sustains half of  V_IN , relaxing the voltage stress of the switches to  V_IN\/2  and enlarging the duty ratio D. However, the two inductors must provide all the output current, thus leading to a large inductor DCR loss. To reduce such loss, [5] proposed a dual-path hybrid buck  (2PHB)  converter (Fig. 11.10.1, bottom left), in which the flying capacitor  C_F  sustains the voltage  V_OUT  and provides an additional output current path.

However, in a wide battery voltage range, they face challenges including dynamic voltage scaling (DVS), wide load current range, and dynamic line\/load transients while ensuring reliability for an industrial usage. To resolve these issues, the conventional buck-boost (CBB) converter should overcome the characteristic of discontinuity in the output transfer current (OTC) which causes degradation of loop dynamics and transient response. Several past works with continuous OTC have been proposed to resolve these problems, but their voltage conversion ratios are limited [1], [2].

However, there are still some design challenges to solve. In continuous-conduction-mode (CCM) control, it is difficult to reduce crosstalk between multiple outputs [1 5]. Any crosstalk will result in excessive or insufficient energy in other outputs, resulting in severe voltage ripple. In the upper left of Fig. 17.7.1, when there is any load change on V_O2, crosstalk will occur at V_O1 and V_O4. On the other hand, in the discontinuous-conduction-mode (DCM) control [6, 7], if any one of the multiple outputs changes from light load to heavy load, serious crosstalk occurs due to the extension of the switching period T_SW, as shown in the upper right of Fig. 17.7.1. Although constant frequency control can avoid the expansion of T_SW [8], the limited peak inductor current will reduce the driving capability (I_LOAD(MAX)=100 mA [8]). In this paper, the proposed SIMO converter, shown at the bottom left of Fig. 17.7.1, uses an adaptive switchable CCM and DCM (ASCD) technique that takes advantage of the high driving capability of CCM and the advantage of reducing crosstalk in DCM under light loads. To effectively reduce the crosstalk in CCM (Mode 1  in this paper), a 5-input crosstalk-reduction error amplifier (CREA) with a feedback rotator is proposed to reduce the shortcomings of hardware overhead in [1 10]. For achieving low crosstalk and high driving capability under medium load, the SIMO converter works in a combination of stacked DCM and sequential DCM, which are classified as Mode 2  to Mode 4  to change the energy distribution path of each output (Fig. 17.7.1 bottom right). Under ultra-light load conditions, the switching cycle T_SW can be extended to reduce switching power loss, and SIMO will enter the ultra-low-power (ULP) mode (Mode 5 ) to further reduce the quiescent current and increase the battery runtime.","source":"ISSCC","title":"17.7 A 0.03mV\/mA Low Crosstalk and 185nA Ultra-Low-Quiescent Single-Inductor Multiple-Output Converter Assisted by 5-Input Operational Amplifier for 94.3"}},{"docId":"1470","weight":0.018565696462433418,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"This paper reviews monolithic GaN integration for power ICs, focusing on current technological capabilities.

It is desirable to accommodate different energy sources (a wide input voltage  V_IN  range), together with a wide range of output voltage  V_OUT  range, from down-to-0.5V to up-to-2V (for button battery). Therefore, a buck-boost converter with high efficiency over a wide voltage conversion ratio (VCR) range is favorable. To reduce the volume and cost, switched-capacitor (SC) converters are in demand. However, a conventional SC only obtains good efficiency at discontinuous VCRs [1] (Fig. 30.7.1). This stems from the large voltage swing  ( V_CF)  on the flying capacitors  C_F  at non-optimum VCRs, leading to large charge sharing loss  (P_CSL)  and  C_F  bottom plate (BP) parasitic capacitance loss (proportional to   V_CF^2) . Multi-phase continuously scalable-conversion-ratio SC (CSC) converters [25] split the large   V_CF  into small steps, with the help of multiple internal voltage rails from the  C_F  of the adjacent phases, and the out-phasing technique [2]. For example, in a CSC step-down converter (Fig. 30.7.1), the  C_F  top plate (TP) in each phase connects to either  V_IN, V_OUT , or the  M  internal TP rails  (V_T1  to  V_TM) , while the bottom plate connects to either  V_OUT , ground  V_SS  or  N  internal BP rails  (V_B1 to V_BN)  . Then the  V_CF  step is   V_T  when TP connects to an internal rail:   V_T=(V_IN-V_OUT)\/(2M+1) . Likewise, the  V_CF  step becomes   V_B  when BP connects to an internal rail:   V_B=V_OUT\/(2N+1) . This reduces the  P_CSL  and BP parasitic losses at non-optimum VCRs, and hence allows a high efficiency over a continuous VCR range. The CSC step-up converter [3] shares the same benefit. Yet, with a fixed  M+N  value (amount of resources consumed), once at a non-optimum VCR, e.g.  V_OUT  becomes small, the reduction in   V_B  is too small such that the efficiency improvement is negligible, while the increased   V_T  degrades the efficiency greatly, as shown in Fig. 30.7.1.","source":"ISSCC","title":"A Continuously Scalable-Conversion-Ratio SC Converter with Reconfigurable VCF Step for High Efficiency over an Extended VCR Range"}},{"docId":"1093","weight":0.01837538427470054,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Gallium Nitride (GaN) is now a popular choice for power conversion.

These GaN HEMT on Si based cascode packages have passed the qualification based on the standards of the Joint Electron Devices Engineering Council (JEDEC) (15) for the first time. High voltage acceleration test was performed up to 1150 V. Even considering most conservative failure mechanism, mean time to failure (MTTF) of over 110 7  hours at 600 V was predicted at 80C. Additional conclusion is that conventional packages such as TO-220 are still suitable for high speed circuit application without using a specific gate driver. Ultimately GaN will significantly reduce conversion losses endemic in all areas of electricity conversion, ranging from power supplies to PV inverters to motion control to electric vehicles, enabling consumers, utilities and governments to contribute towards a more energy efficient world.","source":"IEDM","title":"600 V JEDEC-qualified highly reliable GaN HEMTs on Si substrates"}},{"docId":"2335","weight":0.01710196765392909,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Ubiquitous Internet-of-Everything (IoE) applications require low-cost, miniature sensors with long lifetimes.

Buck converters offer high efficiency, but they cannot satisfy the stringent size requirements because bulky off-chip inductors are required [1]. Switched-capacitor (SC) approaches provide fully integrated power management solutions; however, their power density is limited by the on-chip capacitance density [2]. Resonant switched capacitor (ReSC) converters need 3D die-stacked inductors or PCB-integrated inductors to achieve appropriate power density values, posing challenges for monolithic integration [3]. A fully integrated ReSC has been presented [4], which implements an on-chip resonator, avoiding any external or 3D stacked passive components.

For the TFT gate drivers, high-voltage bipolar supply rails (approximately 15V) are required; so far, they have been typically generated from a battery (VBAT) by employing switched-capacitor converters (SCCs) [1]. Since a high SNR is crucial for TFT-based sensors such as an under-display fingerprint sensor [2], the noise and ripple of the SCC output, which are prone to be coupled to the readout AFE, should be minimized. As a straightforward method, an LDO can be utilized as a post-regulator in series with the SCC. However, the relatively large dropout voltage (V DO ) of the LDO significantly degrades the efficiency [3]. In contrast, small VDO reduces LDO loop-gain due to the pass-transistor working in the triode region, resulting in decreased supply-ripple rejection (PSR). From the perspective of SCC, owing to its fixed voltage conversion ratio (VCR), the VDO cannot be finely regulated over a wide variation of VBAT. For fine regulation, the complexity (cost) overhead or the power loss will increase in the SC circuit. In this work, an energy-recycled optimal VDO control (EROC) technique in the SC bipolar step-up stage is proposed for higher efficiency. Also, load-current-reused (LCR) post-regulator is presented to achieve high PSR while extremely minimizing the power loss at the pass-transistor.","source":"ISSCC","title":"17.8 A 90.5"}},{"docId":"3310","weight":0.016730386855331507,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"With the rapid developments in big data analytics, non-isolated 48V-to-1V converters offer a competitive choice to support the increased power consumptions in CPUs and memories. For realizing a small output-to-input conversion ratio (CR), the conventional buck (CB) converters suffer from extremely short switch on-time that limits high-frequency operation and incurs high power losses. Although the switched-capacitor (SC) converters with lower voltage rating devices can scale down the high input voltage,  _ , high efficiency can only be achieved under fixed conversion ratios. Hybrid converters are thus emerged recently to combine the advantages of CB and SC converters. Converter topologies such as flying-capacitor multi-level (FCML) [1] and hybrid Dickson (HD) [2] adopt an external output LC filter after the SC network to realize continuous conversion range. However, since flying capacitor in [1] and [2] requires proper voltage balancing in the steady state, the switching frequency,  _ , can be significantly slowed down when the converter needs to balance an increased number of the flying capacitor under small CR condition. Both double step-down (DSD) [3] and tri-state DSD [4] topologies can double  _  by using two inductors, but their CR is only  \/2  that limits their capability to support 48V-to-1V conversions. Although the 12-level series-capacitor converter [5] topology significantly decreases the CR, it requires 11 flying capacitors and a    FET as external components.

A resistive DAC (R-DAC) is widely used for its intrinsic low flicker noise. However, the design of a high PSRR and low flicker noise reference generator for R-DAC not only consumes extra power and area with an external RC filter [1] but also limits the peak SNDR performance [2]. In contrast, a current-steering DAC (I-DAC) has intrinsic PSRR. In addition, the use of a tri-level implementation with a dumped buffer reduces noise with a small input signal, which improves dynamic range (DR), but flicker noise from the bias circuit still limits the peak SNR of the ADC. Instead of using large-sized transistors or an off-chip RC filter for required low flicker noise, the sample-and-hold noise filter [3] is proposed for a low noise I-DAC by filtering the bias noise with an off-transistor-based filter, which requires periodic refreshing to compensate the bias voltage drift due to the gate-leakage current of the DAC cells. However, a trade-off between bias voltage drift and folded sampling noise of this technique limits its usage in more advanced technology because larger gate-leakage current is expected. In order to solve aforementioned problems, we introduce a CT-DSM ADC with a gate-leakage compensated off-transistor (GLCOT) based I-DAC bias noise filter without extra off-chip components which is suitable for true wireless stereo (TWS) applications. The ADC achieves 104.4dB DR and 100.6dB SNDR in 24kHz bandwidth while consuming 116  W.

To achieve both a large bandwidth and high dynamic range with a 1 b    modulator, a high OSR and multi-GHz-rate sampling frequency are required. But there is a limit to the maximum sampling frequency of a    modulator, being a negative feedback system, in order to maintain loop stability and sufficiently low metastability, for a given technology node. To date, the maximum achievable bandwidth of a high-resolution 1 b    modulator is limited to a few tens of MHz. To achieve a bandwidth exceeding 100MHz with a single-loop    modulator, multi-bit quantization is essential [3][5]. When employing multi-bit quantization, the inherently linear property of a 1b DAC that consists of only a single unit element is lost, due to processing imperfections that cause mismatch errors between the multiple unit elements of a multi-bit DAC. The impact of static and dynamic mismatch errors can be effectively reduced with calibration, dynamic matching and analog\/digital compensation techniques. State-of-the-art ADCs with bandwidths exceeding 100MHz have reported excellent linearity numbers up to 83dBc THD [4][5], but this is far off from the <-100dBc THD achieved by the ultra-highly linear 1b ADCs.

These nonlinearity levels are much lower than the required ADC noise that is necessary to maintain high reception quality of a weak wanted signal in the presence of strong unfiltered interferers. Such audio-like linearity performance has been demonstrated for low input signal frequencies up to several hundreds of kHz [1-2], but the spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) of ADCs with >10MHz bandwidth is typically limited to 80 to 90dB [3-4] due to static mismatches associated with multi-bit quantization and dynamic errors such as data-dependent disturbances on the DAC supply [1].

As impressive as these bandwidths are for CT ADCs, the required ADC architectures are complex, are sensitive to layout parasitics due to the high sampling rates, and most important of all, are power hungry, consuming several hundreds of mW. In this paper, we propose a filtering rnulti-stage noise-shaping (MASH)  ADC architecture that overcomes the abovementioned drawbacks. Passive delay compensating filters [4] are used to realize broadband and deep suppression of the input signal component at the internal filter nodes of the ADC. As a result, no interstage DACs are needed, which are commonly required to generate the quantization error replicas in a MASH  ADC, saving substantial power and greatly reducing the parasitic load of the high-speed critical nodes. Moreover, because of the absence of signal content at the internal filter nodes, the backend stages of the MASH architecture have relaxed linearity requirements and can be implemented with simple low-power Gm-C filters. Precise excess loop delay and excess phase compensation are accomplished with a partly resistive and capacitive stabilization DAC, enabling very-high-speed operation of the  loops.

This is particularly troublesome when the input to the CTDSM consists of large out-of-band interferers; handling them without saturating the quantizer needs larger inband DR, leading to increased power dissipation. A solution to this problem is to use a filter upfront to attenuate interferers. Alternatively [1], the filter can be moved into the CTDSM loop. In [1], a 1 st -order RC filter was used to tame the STF peak of a cascade of integrators with feedforward summation (CIFF) DSM. Apart from the limited selectivity offered by a 1 st -order filter, an active feedback path was necessary to stabilize the loop. The CTDSM in our work obtains an STF with a sharper transition band and a lower cutoff frequency (normalized to the desired signal bandwidth) compared to [1], with the aim of more effectively attenuating close-in interferers. This is realized by embedding a 2 nd -order active filter into the CTDSM. We show that this has the same functionality as the filter upfront, but achieves better linearity (for the same noise and power dissipation) when compared to the filter-CTDSM cascade. Further, no extra active circuitry is necessary to stabilize the loop. Measurements of a CTDSM (signal BW=2MHz), with a built-in VGA (0 to 18dB) and a 2 nd -order Butterworth filter (4MHz cutoff), show that the out-of-band IIP3 improves by about 10dB when compared to the CTDSM with the filter placed upfront.

Usually the focusing (beamforming) operation is performed for both TX and RX. The RX focusing is performed by an RX beamformer [1-5], which consists of delay elements and adders. Nowadays, digital beamformers (DBF) are mostly used for conventional ultrasound imaging because of high SNR. Recently, 2D ultrasound transducers have been introduced for 3D imaging. Since the 2D transducer has a huge number of transducer elements (e.g., 9216 for a 72128 array), it cannot use DBF because of the huge number of required ADCs and wires inside the probe cable. Therefore, analog beamforming must be performed, at least at the front stage of the 2D transducer.In this work, where a 2D CMUT array is used, the maximum delay difference among transducer elements is 8s with a maximum steering angle of 45 and a maximum focal depth of 15cm. The target sampling resolution is 6.25ns (c \/ 53.3) with a carrier frequency of 3MHz. An analog-digital-hybrid architecture and a non-uniform sampling scheme are used for the RX beamformer of this work to achieve the wide dynamic range of delay time and small chip-area.

An ABF performs the focusing operation for the input signals of the adjacent 8 channels to generate an analog output signal. The 8 analog output signals from the 8 ABFs are applied to the DBF.

For each transducer element, such an ASIC contains a pulser that drives the element to generate a pressure wave, a low-noise amplifier (LNA) that amplifies the resulting echo signal, and a time-gain compensation (TGC) circuit that compensates for the time-varying echo-signal amplitude due to propagation attenuation of the acoustic wave. Without TGC, the first echoes, from shallow tissue, are much larger than later echoes from deeper tissue. The TGC circuit corrects for this, ideally by providing a gain that increases exponentially with time, thus reducing the dynamic range (DR) by as much as 40dB and strongly relaxing the requirements of subsequent blocks. In conventional ultrasound systems, TGC is typically performed after the LNA, implying that a power-hungry LNA is required that can handle the full DR of the echo signal [5], [6]. In recent in-probe ASICs, programmable-gain LNAs have been employed that provide a step-wise TGC approximation [1]-[3]. While this saves power, the associated gain-switching transients lead to imaging artefacts. In this paper, we present an LNA with a built-in continuous TGC function that mitigates this problem.

When a 3D scanning optical system is used to control the position of a laser spot, single-cell precision can be achieved in a volume of tissue containing millions of cells.

By distributing multiple high-density extracellular micro-electrode arrays (MEAs) in vivo across the brain, each with 1000's of sensing channels, neuroscientists have begun to map the correlation of neuronal activity across different brain regions, with single-neuron precision [1]. Since each neural sensing channel typically samples at 20 to 50kS\/s with a > 10b ADC, multiple MEAs demand a data transfer rate up to Gb\/s [2]. However, these BCIs are severely hindered in many clinical uses due to the lack of a high-data-rate and miniature-wireless-telemetry solution that can be implanted below the scalp, i.e., transcutaneously (Fig. 24.2.1). The area of the wireless telemetry module should be miniaturized to 3cm 2  due to neurosurgical implantation constraints. A transmission range up to 10cm is highly desirable, in order to improve the reliability of the wireless link against e.g., antenna misalignment, etc. Finally, the power consumption of the wireless telemetry should be limited to 10mW to minimize thermal flux from the module's surface area, avoiding excessive tissue heating. Most of the conventional transcutaneous wireless telemetry systems adopt inductive coupling, but the data-rate is limited to a few Mb\/s.

To merge a large number of channels into a single battery-free chip, there are two conventional topologies (Fig. 31.4.1, left): 1) The wireless system used multiple analog front-ends (AFEs) for signal acquisition and merges the signals before a single analog-to-digital converter (ADC) [24]. Even with shared ADC circuits, it still consumes high power and chip area, such as  50W  power\/channel and 0  32mm^2  area\/channel in [4]. 2) Multiple channels are merged before the AFE, and then both the power consumption and chip area can be further reduced by sharing the AFE and ADC.

While EEG is an established method for non-invasive electrical activity, electrical-impedance tomography (EIT) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can additionally measure impedance changes and hemodynamic processes. To facilitate long-term multi-channel brain imaging in a wearable form factor without cabling overhead, there is a need for low-power local amplifiers [1] to support all these modalities. The main principle of optical hemodynamic measurements is to send light pulses into the tissue and measure the reflected light, which is modulated by the oxygen levels in the blood (Fig. 17.8.1). State-of-the-art NIRS ICs typically consume a few mW, primarily for the LEDs to meet the required light sensitivity at the photodiodes (PDs). Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are promising alternatives because they have excellent low-light detection capabilities, speed of response and higher detection efficiency in both visible and near infrared range [2]. Hence, SiPMs allow deeper brain sensing depth and the possibility to sample consistent cerebral regions with larger inter-optode distance. This benefit would significantly reduce the number of NIRS channels and the associated power for a wearable NIRS device. Although SiPMs require a higher bias voltage (30V) than PDs, they achieve similar NIRS responses with a few hundred times less LED current. This results in a low-power NIRS ASIC and an overall power-efficient system. Existing optical sensing ICs are not suitable for a SiPM because of its large and variable output current. Trimming-based calibration methods [3] suffer from drift over time. Auto-zeroing by swapping an integrator capacitor [4][5] compensates ambient light at the cost of the integrator's headroom.

The active stylus system does not require the additional sensing panel but needs a battery located inside the stylus. On the other hand, ECR stylus systems are cost-effective without needing either the additional sensing panel or a built-in battery. Furthermore, ECR stylus systems measure pen pressure by sensing a stylus' resonant frequency change upon pressure without additional circuitry [3]. Due to the external noise injection to the stylus system being more than ten times larger than the pen signal as shown in Fig. 10.4.1, noise immunity is a key performance factor for commercialization. This paper proposes an analog front-end (AFE) for both ECR and active stylus systems with high noise immunity that results in improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by applying a fully differential architecture, adjustable frequency modulation (AFM), and linear-interpolating data reconstruction (LIDR).","source":"ISSCC","title":"A noise-immune stylus analog front-end using adjustable frequency modulation and linear-interpolating data reconstruction for both electrically coupled resonance and active styluses"}},{"docId":"2912","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"As the demand for high frame rate and SNR increases in capacitive touch systems (CTSs), several driving methods have been reported [1], [5]. However, when excitation circuits simultaneously send excitation signals V EXT s to multiple TX electrodes in order to increase frame rate, the readout circuit suffers from charge overflow because of the superposition of V EXT s. To prevent this, driving methods such as time-division [1], [5] and reduced-amplitude excitation [3], and signal omitting and linear interpolation in the digital domain [4] have been adopted in AFE ICs, but they degrade the frame rate, and SNR, and increase the computational load of the CTS, respectively. In this paper, amplitude-modulated multiple-frequency excitation (AM-MFE) is used to prevent charge overflow without degrading the frame rate, SNR, and computational load. In addition, an electric pencil case (EPC) is proposed for wireless power and data transfer to an active stylus, so as to avoid the need to replace the battery of the stylus or charge it via an adapter.","source":"ISSCC","title":"28.1 A Capacitive Touch Chipset with 33.9dB Charge-Overflow Reduction Using Amplitude-Modulated Multi-Frequency Excitation and Wireless Power and Data Transfer to an Active Stylus"}},{"docId":"3547","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Recently, there have been many advances in user interaction systems in mobile devices. In addition to traditional capacitive touch systems, a stylus is becoming mainstream, which is a very useful feature for large-sized tablet PCs [1]. However, wearable devices, which are composed of inevitably small display panels, need a new interaction system for improved convenience. This paper presents a virtual rotating gesture-recognition IC (VRGR-IC) on a bezel area for a wearable device employing a circular display. For an implementation of the VRGR, the sensors should be placed below the bezel. However, the bracket to assemble the display and main body of a wearable device makes it unable to place any sensors in that position, as shown in the top of Fig. 26.2.1. To alternatively implement that function, two key features of this work include: 1) an integrated capacitive touch and VRGR system, which enables traditional 2-D touch sensing on a display's active area and near-field 3-D hover gesture on the bezel area, and 2) a haptic generating system, which provides continual haptic feedback responsive to a finger rotation. More specifically, the bottom of Fig. 26.2.1 shows the operational principle of the VRGR system, which incorporates a touch-screen panel (TSP), VRGR-IC, AMOLED display, display driver IC (DDl), application processor (AP), and linear resonant actuator (LRA). When the TSP is touched, the VRGR IC extracts both the touch coordinates  (_1,_1) (_,_)  of multi-finger as well as an angle of rotation on a bezel by a finger. Those are sent to the AP, which sends back the haptic generation requests to the VRGR IC when a rotated angle is reached to a reference  _ .

Recently, there has been an attempt to adopt 2-D self-capacitance multi-touch sensors in flexible OLEDs over 10 in size to reduce capacitive loads. Due to encapsulation of thickness less than  10m , capacitive loads over 500pF are formed under the conventional bar-type sensor. Nevertheless, there remain problems with limited signal bandwidth, large offset charge, and severe common display noise injection due to a large capacitive load. To overcome the problems, area- and power-efficient AFEs have been announced [2], [3]. However, those studies have only focused on mutual-capacitance sensing with light capacitive load and mostly rely on differential voltages\/current signaling, so requiring wider dynamic range and more accurate voltage\/current sensing. Therefore, this paper presents a touch screen controller for a 2-D self-capacitance sensor supporting an active stylus in a large capacitive load. The noise antenna reference shielding (NARS) improves immunity to common-mode noise injection, and achieves 27.7dB SNR with in-band common noise of 180pC. Moreover, a baseline current compensator (BCC) provides a large baseline current up to 300pC and extends dynamic range for the external interference. In addition, an area-efficient architecture for the active stylus using single-bin DFT is presented for 216-channel AFEs; it occupies 49.7mm2, and shows 62dB SNR with a 1mm-    tip active stylus at 480fps.","source":"ISSCC","title":"26.3 A 45.8dB-SNR 120fps 100pF-Load Self-Capacitance Touch-Screen Controller with Enhanced In-Band Common Noise Immunity Using Noise Antenna Reference"}},{"docId":"2432","weight":0.91748468646615,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Touch screens have recently been adopted not only for smartphones but also for tablet PCs and home appliances that have touch-screen panels (TSPs) larger than 10 inches.

For example, as shown in Fig. 11.6.1, common-mode supply noise results in large peak-to-peak noise injection over 10Vpp and deteriorates touch-detection performance. Although rejection of display noise using the differential sensing method [3] has been investigated, sufficient attenuation of the injected noise through a touch object remains a problem. In this paper, we present an analog front-end (AFE) with noise immunity of up to 20Vpp for a large TSP controller. To improve the immunity to the injected noise, the proposed AFE employs the following techniques: a) TX\/RX dual modulation, b) differential sensing, c) high-order noise filtering, and d) multiple TX driving frequency support.

This is achieved by directly digitizing brain activity in situ, thus avoiding a large base and allowing the probe to have a base and shank of equal width. However, this comes with a lower spatial resolution and an increased power density in the probe shank.

However, current active matrix OLED (AMOLED) displays on foil do not validate this power-efficient advantage, as too much power is lost in the AM backplane. AMOLED displays use the analog voltage on the gate of a drive transistor (e.g. M1 in Fig. 30.2.1) to control the pixel current and hence the pixel brightness. Accurate and uniform pixel currents can only be obtained when transistor M1 is driven is saturation. In highresolution technologies on foil, transistor parameters W, L and the mobility  are limited by technology, imposing a minimal V GS -V T  to obtain sufficient current, i.e. V GS -V T  > 4V for a-IGZO on foil [1]. Subsequently, to obtain saturation, V DS  > 4V, which translates in a static backplane power loss surpassing the OLED power consumption (see red stars in Fig 30.2.1). However, when the OLED pixel impedance around a specific reference current can be matched along a display column line, the accurate pixel current control can be imposed by current DACs implemented in external silicon display column drivers. In this work, we operate M1 as a switch and pixel intensity variations are obtained using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) of a predefined pixel current, i.e. 2A\/pixel [8080m 2 ] (which corresponds in our OLED technology to a light output of 2000Cd\/m 2 ). When, in a future implementation the external DACs are calibrated at 0.2A\/pixel, the full brightness would correspond to the typical display brightness of a portable PC, i.e. 200Cd\/m 2 . This concept enables us to reduce the display power voltage at full brightness from 8.2V in a classical AMOLED display on foil configuration to 5V (measured) and for future implementations even down to 4V (see Fig. 30.2.1). As the OLED current load remains equal, a corresponding static power reduction of the display (and increased battery lifetime) is obtained. Digital driving methods of AMOLED displays have been shown before. However,  techniques [2] still integrate charge packets on the gate of M1 and hence do not solve the power issue on foil. Other PWM techniques [3] activate only a single active line in the linedriver yielding difficulties to obtain color depths above 6 bits. When multiple independent linedrivers are implemented and their output is multiplexed to alternately drive a single select line, a higher color depth can be obtained [4]. This leads however to a bulky linedriver, which is hard to get within an e.g. 80m pitch. The design and implementation of a compact integrated linedriver on foil enabling multiple alternating active signals through a single shift register is demonstrated here.","source":"ISSCC","title":"30.2 Digital PWM-driven AMOLED display on flex reducing static power consumption"}},{"docId":"2832","weight":0.019223895780845948,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Tactile sensing has wide-ranging applications, from intelligent surfaces to advanced robotics.

However, low performance\/energy-efficiency of LAE thin-film transistors (TFTs) necessitates hybrid systems, integrating Si-CMOS ICs for system functions (sensor readout\/control, processing, etc.). Initial work shows that a primary challenge in hybrid systems is the large number of interfaces required between LAE and CMOS, particularly as the number of sensors scales [1,2]. This paper presents a force-sensing system that exploits signal sparsity exhibited in many large-area tactile-sensing applications (e.g., detecting point damage\/stress in structures [3]), to reduce interfacing complexity to the level of sparsity, rather than a level related to the number of sensors (e.g., [1]). This is achieved via compressed sensing (CS), enabling sensor-acquisition by simple switches, readily implemented using TFTs. While CS has previously been leveraged in a hybrid-system architecture targeting signal sampling-rate requirements [2], this system applies it for high spatial resolution in tactile sensing.","source":"ISSCC","title":"17.3 Hybrid System for Efficient LAE-CMOS Interfacing in Large-Scale Tactile-Sensing Skins via TFT-Based Compressed Sensing"}},{"docId":"2791","weight":0.019181093847193045,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"The evolution of tissue-penetrating probes for high-density deep-brain recording of in vivo neural activity is limited by the level of electronic integration on the probe shaft. As the number of electrodes increases, conventional devices need either a large number of interconnects at the base of the probe or allow only a reduced number of electrodes to be read out simultaneously [1,2]. Active probes are used to improve the signal quality and reduce parasitic effects in situ, but still need to route these signals from the electrodes to a base where the readout electronics is located on a large area [3,4]. In this work, we present a modular and scalable architecture of a needle probe, which, instead of routing or prebuffering noise-sensitive analog signals along the shaft, integrates analog-to-digital conversion under each electrode in an area of 7070m 2 . The design eliminates the need for any additional readout circuitry at the top of the probe and connects with a digital 4-wire interface. The presented reconfigurable 11.5mm probe features a constant width of 70m and thickness of 50m from top to bottom for minimal tissue damage with 144 integrated recording sites and can be fully immersed in tissue for deep-brain recording applications.","source":"ISSCC","title":"A fully immersible deep-brain neural probe with modular architecture and a delta-sigma ADC integrated under each electrode for parallel readout of 144 recording sites"}},{"docId":"2028","weight":0.019040671324188036,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Storing data on DNA molecules is an alternative to traditional storage media by promoting density and longevity.

However, compared to NRZ, the design of a PAM-4 TX is challenged by tight linearity constraints, required to minimize the amplitude distortion among the 4 levels [1]. In principle, current-mode (CM) drivers can deliver a differential peak-to-peak swing up to 4\/3(VDD-VOV), but they struggle to generate high-swing PAM-4 levels with the required linearity. This is confirmed by recently published CM PAM-4 drivers, showing limited output swings even with VDD raised to 1.5V [2-4].

The power consumption increases exponentially to suppress comparator noise in a limited comparison time to improve SNR. Noise-tolerant SAR ADCs [1] reduce comparator power in the first few bit cycles by using a coarse comparator. However, the fine comparator in the remaining bit cycles still consumes significant power to achieve an SNR greater than 60dB.

Using a low-gain or a dynamic amplifier induces gain errors between stages. Besides, the amplifier and back-end stages result in extra noise and area. Digital-slope ADCs [4] are inherently low-noise by quantizing the signal in the time domain, but the hardware cost grows exponentially with resolution and the maximum conversion rate is halved with each additional bit of resolution.

While they are most commonly implemented using PLLs, it is becoming increasingly difficult to design them in a power efficient manner, as their jitter requirements grow more stringent. Recognizing that the main limitation of PLLs arises from limited RO noise suppression bandwidth (NBW = F REF \/10), multiplying delay-locked loops (MDLLs) that suppress noise by replacing a RO's noisy edge with a clean reference clock edge have gained prominence [1-3]. Such an edge replacement operation suppresses RO noise with an increased NBW of about F REF \/4 [1]. However, imperfections of edge replacement logic have limited the output frequency of MDLLs [1, 2] or degraded their jitter performance at frequencies beyond 2.5GHz [3]. Furthermore, MDLLs are susceptible to transistor non-idealities and require elaborate analog calibration schemes that are prone to circuit imperfections [2, 3]. In contrast to PLLs and MDLLs, injection-locked clock multipliers (ILCMs) lock RO frequency to an integer multiple (N) of F REF  by injecting narrow pulses at F REF  into the RO whose free running frequency is about NF  REF  [4]. Because ILCMs do not require logic that needs to adhere to stringent timing requirements (like MDLLs) they are better suited for generating high frequencies. However, their jitter performance is limited by: (i) smaller NBW ( F REF \/6) compared to MDLLs, (ii) limited suppression of RO flicker noise due to their Type-I response, and (iii) the need for RO free running frequency, F FR , to be close to NF REF  for maintaining low jitter performance across voltage and temperature. These factors limit the multiplication factor (usually to less than 10) and degrade power efficiency [4,5].

A PLL that directly generates mm-band LO signals is not a good choice due to power-hungry frequency dividers and relatively poor PN. An mm-band LO generator, cascading a GHz-range PLL and a frequency multiplier as shown in Fig. 19.2.1, is an attractive solution. First, a GHz-range PLL can have a higher FOM than a mm-band PLL [1]. Second, the cascaded architecture is naturally able to support the bands for 2G to 4G standards. An injection-locked frequency multiplier (ILFM) is popular in a mm-band, achieving ultra-low PN even in a tight power budget. However, the vulnerability of PN to PVT variations is a critical problem. For an ILFM, the PN performance can be improved only when the free-running VCO frequency, f VCO , and the target frequency are sufficiently close within the lock range, f L , which is very narrow, especially, at high frequencies. To calibrate f VCO  over PVT, many frequency-tracking loops (FTLs) have used a power-hungry circuit (such as a replica-VCO, a TDC, and a counter) operating at f VCO , but they were not suitable for a mm-band ILFM. The sub-sampling FTL [2] used the voltage levels of the VCO outputs, momentarily sampled by injection pulses. However, for the accurate sampling, the pulse width of the injection pulses must be very narrow, since the sampling occurs at the edges of the pulses. For a mm-band VCO, the pulse width must be less than 10ps, but these narrow pulses limit the injection strength and f L . In the mm-band ILFM of [3], the mixers and dividers consumed a lot of power.

The design of a bang-bang digital PLL for wireless standards has two main challenges: quantization noise must be kept below the tolerable spot phase noise and fast lock must be guaranteed even for wide frequency steps. However, the overload of the BPD causes bang-bang PLLs to fail lock or to exhibit extremely long transients. A similar issue appears in the design of sub-sampling PLLs. This problem is exacerbated when the bang-bang PLL is designed for low phase noise for the tight resolution required of the digitally controlled oscillator (DCO). Fast locking techniques are usually based on the use of lookup tables [2], finite state machine [3], or gear shifting techniques, mostly in the field of clock-and-data recovery circuits (CDR) where spot noise performance is less of a concern.

In the sense that the VCO jitter is removed periodically by the reference clock, S REF , an MDLL also can be considered to be an ILCM. However, the most critical problem of ILCMs is that their jitter performance can degrade easily due to PVT. To ensure ultra-low jitter robustly, ILCMs must be equipped with background calibration that continuously adjusts the free-running frequency of the VCO, f VCO , to stay close to the target frequency, Nf REF , where N is the multiplication factor and f REF  is the frequency of S REF , thereby minimizing the frequency error. To date, various calibrating methods have been developed, and many of them [1]-[4] successfully tracked f VCO  and prevented the degradation in random jitter, but none of the ILCMs succeeded in reducing reference spurs to a level comparable to that of PLLs. This is because even a slight phase error of an edge of the output signal, S OUT , could result in large reference spurs [1]. There are three major causes of the phase error, the first of which is the frequency error due to drifts in f VCO  away from Nf REF , which is the main target of prior calibrators. The second cause is the phase offset, which is generated due to any systematic errors of calibrators, such as mismatches in delay cells, input offsets of phase detectors, and limited resolution of digital circuits. Recently, state-of-the-art ILCMs [3], [4] successfully addressed these two causes, but they still could not reduce reference spurs to less than -65dBc.

A lower frequency voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) together with a frequency multiplier can lower the phase noise [1]; however, the high-order harmonic components in VCOs are usually very weak, which requires additional power-consuming mm-wave amplification stages to satisfy the LO swing requirement. For single mm-wave fundamental VCOs, the minimal achievable phase noise is bounded by the smallest realizable inductor that displays a high Q factor. To avoid the small inductor problem, N oscillators with relatively large inductors can be coupled together to improve the phase noise by 10log 10 (N) [2-5].

However, the four one-turn inductors still suffer from the Q-factor drop when the inductance decreases, thus limiting the highest achievable oscillation frequency. Besides, VDD at the inductor central taps and VSS at the tail current source are far from each other, making the V DD -V SS  current return path long. This path has to be carefully modeled in simulations, especially in the mm-wave frequency range, where the return path inductance is comparable to the tank inductance.

The destructive coupling between the inner edges inside a small inductor is eliminated. Therefore, the minimal realizable inductance is further reduced while keeping a high Q factor. The central taps are connected by narrow metal traces to avoid latching and mode ambiguity. The VCO adopts a CMOS configuration, which limits the highest operating frequency. It would be difficult for this topology to be adopted in NMOS-only VCOs because the central taps have to be resistively isolated to suppress unwanted modes; therefore, they cannot be connected to the AC-ground power supply simultaneously as required by the NMOS-only configuration.

Recent work reports a 4 th -order NS-SAR by cascading two 2 nd -order EF structures, showing better simplicity over classic single-loop designs [3]. However, the use of static amps keeps power high.

Currently, the use of a digital-to-time converter (DTC) to cancel the quantization noise (Q-noise) is popular, but fractional spurs due to the nonlinearity of the DTC (NL DTC ) are a critical problem, especially for RO-DPLLs that require a wide bandwidth to suppress the RO jitter.

The time-invariant probability modulation (TIPM) [2] at the top of Fig. 32.1.1 is another method to cope with NLDTC. It uses a property that, if the DTC code is modulated such that its probability density function (PDF) is time-invariant (TI), the expected value of the output is constant even after experiencing NLDTC so that the generation of fractional spurs can be avoided. However, since the TIPM avoids spurs by spreading out their noise power, it cannot reduce the rms jitter (or IPN) itself.

The key in an NS SAR is the NS filter. As shown in Fig. 27.1.1, prior NS filter techniques can be classified into two types. The first way is to use a closed-loop amplifier-based integrator [1-3]. With sufficient gain of the amplifier, this type of integrator can realize a sharp noise transfer function (NTF). However, the high-gain multi-stage amplifier produces large noise, is power-consuming and unfriendly to technology scaling [2,3].

The fully passive filter avoids using closed-loop amplifiers, but it has signal attenuation issue and the resulting NTF is mild [4]. Also, due to the lack of effective gain, it suffers from large comparator noise. To improve the NTF and noise suppression capability, some works place an open-loop amplifier before the passive filter [5-7], or implement a passive gain after it [8].

Given their potential use as carrier frequencies for the next-generation mobiles (i.e., beyond 5G), these W-band signals must have ultra-low phase noise (PN). Currently, the most popular solution to generate such frequencies is with a cascaded architecture: a first-stage PLL generates a low-PN signal at a relatively low frequency at which the VCO LC tank has a high Q factor, and following frequency multipliers (FMs) increase the frequency to the W-band [1]. Although various FMs have been proposed, all of them are limited in their ability to achieve a high multiplication factor, M. Push-push or harmonic-selection circuits have high conversion losses. Injection-locked FMs (ILFMs) require multiple stages due to their narrow lock ranges, which increase power consumption and complexity. Thus, single-stage direct PLLs [2-4] would be preferred if they could have a sufficiently wide loop bandwidth to suppress the poor PN of a W-band VCO. Subsampling PLLs (SSPLLs) are suitable for extending the bandwidth since they have low in-band PN due to the high phase-error ( ERR ) detection gain of a subsampling phase detector (PD). Nevertheless, when SSPLLs operate in the W-band, the degradation of PN is unavoidable because the  ERR  detection gain decreases as the frequency of the VCO, f VCO , increases. As described at the left of Fig. 23.4.1, when the switch of the PD, SWPD, is closed, the output of the PD, SPD, should track the signal of the VCO, S VCO , closely. However, when f VCO  increases to the W-band, the amplitude of SPD is reduced significantly by a parasitic pole that is present due to the turned-on resistance of SW PD , R ON , and the sampling capacitor, CS. When SWPD is turned off,  ERR  is detected in SPD, but its magnitude is already suppressed significantly relative to that in SVCO. This effect also can be interpreted in the frequency domain where S VCO  is suppressed by a low-pass filter before the information of  ERR  is extracted at the baseband frequencies.","source":"ISSCC","title":"23.4 An 82fsrms-Jitter and 22.5mW-Power, 102GHz W-Band PLL Using a Power-Gating Injection-Locked Frequency-Multiplier-Based Phase Detector in 65nm CMOS"}},{"docId":"3192","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"The ever-increasing Internet data demand imposes stringent requirements on wireline transceiver speed, jitter, and power. A low-noise, multi-phase clock generator (MPCG) is a crucial building block in both forwarded-clock and clock-data-recovery (CDR) based clocking systems (Fig. 11.4.1). In CDR-based systems, a global phase-locked loop generates a low-noise, differential clock and distributes it to each lane, where a local phase adjuster, consisting of a multi-phase clock generator and phase interpolators (PIs), compensates the frequency and phase errors between the incoming data and quadrature clocks; while in a forwarded-clock system, the forwarded clock from the transmitter is adjusted by a delay line for phase deskew and the MPCG generates multiple phases for the ADCs. Multi-phase injection-locked ring oscillators (MPILOSCs) [1,2] provide accurate, low-noise, multi-phase clocks thanks to their wide locking range and symmetric structure, but generating the multi-phase injection signals with a poly-phase filter [1] or from a double\/quadruple frequency [2] is power-hungry. Also, the circuits in [1,2] lack calibration for ROSC free-running frequency (f osc ) variations over PVT. Two-phase (0 and 180) IL-ROSCs with a quadrature-locked loop (OLL) are low-power, low-area MPCGs for PIs [3-5]; differential clocks are injected into the ROSC, while the OLL adjusts the ROSC biasing to suppress the IO output error, assuming that when the f osc  = f inj , the injection frequency, the smallest IO output error and the widest ROSC noise suppression bandwidth are obtained for a given injection strength. However, simulations (Fig. 11.4.2) show that the smallest IO error occurs when f osc  is near the lower edge of the locking range due to the imbalance introduced by two-phase injection, while the optimum jitter point remains at f osc  = f inj . As a result, when using a OLL, the injection strength has to be increased to get a sufficiently large noise suppression bandwidth. However, the stronger injection degrades the amplitude and slope balance between stages with injection, and stages without injection, which degrades the phase accuracy. In a OLL-based architecture, there is a tradeoff among IO accuracy, jitter, and power consumption.","source":"ISSCC","title":"11.4 A High-Accuracy Multi-Phase Injection-Locked 8-Phase 7GHz Clock Generator in 65nm with 7b Phase Interpolators for High-Speed Data Links"}},{"docId":"3198","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"With continuous exploitation of sub-6GHz wireless communication standards and the advent of 5G and 6G, the demand for faster speed and wider coverage keeps evolving.

Although fractional-N phase-locked loops (PLLs) employing digital-to-time converters (DTCs) and sampling phase detectors (SPDs) have demonstrated integrated jitter below 100fs [1, 2], such a DTC remains the most challenging block in this PLL architecture. It needs to achieve a fine resolution (e.g., 0.3ps) for low quantization noise (ON) and a large delay range to cancel the quantization error (OE) due to the delta-sigma modulator (DSM) used for fractional-N synthesis (e.g., 400ps for a5GHz VCO and mash1-1 DSM).

Also, maximizing battery lifetime, efficiency, or power consumption is of great concern for these systems. The oscillator is thus required to have a low phase noise as well as a high figure-of-merit (FoM). Recently, to reduce the noise sensitivity of the LC oscillator, various harmonic shaping techniques [1] [3] have been reported. By setting the differential-mode (DM) [1], [2] or common-mode (CM) [1], [3] resonances at specific harmonic frequencies, the impulse sensitive function (ISF) is reduced, and a high FoM could be achieved. However, to meet the strict relationship between fundamental frequency and resonances, the frequency tuning plan is complex, and the frequency range is limited. Besides, the minimum phase noise performance is still limited by the reduced power supply of advanced process and the maximum power taken by a single-core resonate tank. To overcome these limitations, the low-phase-noise oscillators have evolved from the single-core to multi-core types [4], [5]. By coupling N oscillators together, it is possible to burn N times higher power and decrease the phase noise by 10log(N), with the FoM unchanged. Nevertheless, the multi-core coupling method needs to be designed carefully to prevent concurrent oscillations [5]. Meanwhile, the conventional multi-core oscillators only achieve an average FoM of 189dB\/Hz [4], [5], which is significantly worse than the state-of-the-art single-core oscillators.

However, the periodic phase realignment in an ILCM can cause a deterministic phase error in the injection moment, which generates an extremely poor reference spur (e.g., 50dBc). Several digital calibration techniques [1][5] have been introduced to reduce the reference spur. The key is to first detect sources of non-idealities (e.g., imperfect injection timing, frequency drift, and slope modulation), and then to enable a specific calibrator to correct each error source. Unfortunately, there are many non-idealities that can affect the injection performance, such as supply ripples, charge injection of the switches, and clock feedthrough, making it impractical to employ multiple calibration loops to simultaneously mitigate each of them. On the other hand, conventional phase-error-detection schemes [2][3], [5] suffer from the timing race between the calibration loop and the injection, and hence elaborate timing control is required to extract errors. This timing-control logic is sensitive to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations, leading to inadequate mitigation of the reference spurious power.","source":"ISSCC","title":"A 0.021mm2 65nm CMOS 2.5GHz Digital Injection-Locked Clock Multiplier with Injection Pulse Shaping Achieving 79dBc Reference Spur and 0.496mW\/GHz Power Efficiency"}},{"docId":"3290","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Modern SoCs for advanced wireless\/wired applications integrate an increasing number of PLLs. 5G TRXs require multiple PLLs to implement complex schemes of carrier aggregation and MIMO.

To overcome the well-known problem of the high jitter of an RO, the general design guideline is to extend the loop bandwidth. However, this strategy cannot be applied readily to a fractional- N  architecture, since a wide bandwidth cannot prevent various in-band noise sources from degrading the overall jitter. Recently, many techniques have been presented to suppress those noise sources.

The graph of the in-band noise sources at the top right of Fig. 23.2.1 shows that, to further decrease the rms jitter, the next challenge is to reduce the thermal noise of the DTC, which increases in proportion to its required range [4].

High f SW  incurs larger di\/dt and dv\/dt transitions which injects high frequency electromagnetic interference (EMI) noise into the input bus. This creates unwanted noise or even a malfunction in a safety-critical system. A bulky input filter can reduce EMI, but it greatly increases size and cost. Several techniques [2-5] are reported to mitigate EMI. Frequency hopping using discrete frequencies is proposed in [2], but cannot spread the frequency evenly to lower the peak noise effectively. Alternatively, a series resistor is typically added at the gate of the GaN FET to slow down the transition [3-4]. However, the switching loss is dramatically increased. To mitigate this, adjustable driving strength is proposed in [5]. Unfortunately, the sensing and driver delays confine its use in low f SW  applications, where the switch node rising time is several tens or hundreds of ns. Another issue of high f SW  operation is that it causes significant current and voltage spikes due to the parasitics at the drain\/source of the high side GaN FET (M H ), which could lead to GaN VDS breakdown or damage on logic-level FETs.

This not only hampers the long-term recording but also causes user discomfort. However, it is very challenging to perform small-size dry-electrode BioZ sensing at the frequency range of 1kHz to 1MHz, where both the increased electrode-tissue impedance (ETI) (-10MII0.5nF) and input parasitic capacitance  C_p(> 10pF)  play a dominating role in attenuating the input signal (Fig. 20.1.1), resulting in gain inaccuracy and a long settling time [3]. To solve this issue, a BioZ amplifier with calibrated positive feedback [3] was proposed for input impedance boosting, which enables 1cm 2  dry-electrode BioZ sensing. Second, to identify small BioZ variation (0.01 to  1 ) over higher baseline impedance, i.e., ETI plus the static BioZ component, both the excitation current generator (CG) and the BioZ amplifier must feature low noise. Although dynamic element matching (DEM) is effective in alleviating the 1\/f current noise of the CG [2], the input-signal-dependent noise of the amplifier remains a notable problem that severely reduces the measurement accuracy when the BioZ signal is large [4]. Furthermore, previous CGs employing complementary current sources suffer from current mismatch, resulting in low output impedance and limited voltage headroom [1][2]. A unipolar CG solves this problem, but both the sinusoidal CG and current sink amplifier are power-hungry [3]. Finally, state-of-the-art BioZ readouts [1][3] still require an extra electrode to bias the body and provide the input common-mode (CM) voltage, which further increases the system complexity.","source":"ISSCC","title":"A 0.5m\/Hz 106dB SNR 0.45cm2 Dry-Electrode Bioimpedance Interface with Current Mismatch Cancellation and Boosted Input Impedance of 100M at 50kHz"}},{"docId":"3565","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Electronic biosensors are transducers that convert biomolecular or cellular information to electronic readouts.

Conventional physiological tools such as imaging and labeling are insufficient to cope with neural signals from cells distributed over a large area [1]. Microelectrode array (MEA) systems featuring high-density electrodes and low-noise analog front-ends (AFE) have been representative solutions to acquire intracellular and extracellular potentials from in vitro multiple neurons [2  7]. Although the number of electrodes in MEA systems and their spatial resolution are increased thanks to advances in CMOS technology, they still suffer from area constraints in the low - noise AFE and connection complexity from electrodes to corresponding AFE channels. Since neurons are not fully activated and not evenly distributed after being cultivated on an MEA, a full scanning of electrodes in active pixel sensors (APS) is not efficient in terms of power consumption and noise performance [2  4]. A switch - matrix (SM) architecture offers high flexibility to select and record electrodes of interest through configuring the switches to randomly connect them to AFE channels, improving efficiency [5,6]. However, a large AFE channel dedicated to an electrode with a small pitch of a few pm limits the scalability in both APS and SM architectures. The more electrodes are integrated into the system, the more complicated the routing connections become, worsening scalability. In this paper, an MEA system with a sub-array multiplexing (SAM) architecture is presented for programmable electrode selection and readout speed to maximize the ratio of the number of recorded electrodes per frame to the total number of electrodes, called an electrode yield. A time-multiplexing scheme allows each AFE channel in a column to record multiple electrodes one-by-one in a given sampling time, alleviating the routing complexity and the number of AFE channels.

CMI degrades the signal quality in two ways. First, it appears as a differential-mode signal together with the ECG, because of common-mode to differential-mode (CM-DM) conversion. This is often due to the electrode impedance mismatch [1], as contacts inevitably lose their properties differently during long-term recording. Second, CMI that exceeds the supply voltage saturates the amplifier and distorts the recording when the subject is near power lines [4]. To address both of these issues, the recoding IC must withstand large CMI and also have a large total-CMRR (T-CMRR) that includes the effect of electrode mismatch. Unfortunately, prior works provide solutions to only one of them, and thus there is a lack of reliable long-term ECG recording in a practical setting. In [2, 3], CM-DM conversion is addressed by increasing the input impedance in common-mode. However, the IA fails when there is large CMI. In addition, one of the main issues of the input impedance boosting method is that chopping, despite its benefit in 1\/f noise reduction, cannot be used, as it reduces the input impedance. Hence, a CM-DM suppression technique that is effective for low input impedance IA is desired. In [4, 5], tolerance to CMI is improved by absorbing the CMI current. However, their T-CMRRs are poor (65 dB). In this work, we propose a CMI-tolerant amplifier with an adaptive CMI-canceling technique. It ensures 100 dB of T-CMRR when there is an electrode mismatch of 152k  and CMI of 15V, even when the input capacitance is as large as 120pF.","source":"ISSCC","title":"28.6 A 22.6 W Biopotential Amplifier with Adaptive Common-Mode Interference Cancelation Achieving Total-CMRR of 104dB and CMI Tolerance of 15Vpp in 0.18m CMOS"}},{"docId":"205","weight":0.6189277258150528,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Electronic biochips are defined by the merge of integrated electronics, containing diverse sensors, with reaction solution and sample hold in reaction chamber(s).

To improve robustness, so-called noise-independent training can be considered, which is to use the training data that includes all the possible SNR levels and noise types. But, this approach is challenging for an ultra-low-power device since it demands a large neural network to learn all the possible features. A neural network of a fixed size has its own memory capacity limit and reaches a plateau in accuracy if it has to learn more than its limit (Fig. 9.9.1, top right). On the other hand, it is known that biological acoustic systems employ a simpler process, called divisive energy normalization (DN), to maintain accuracy even in varying noise conditions. In this work, therefore, by adopting such a DN, we prototype a normalized acoustic feature extractor chip (NAFE) in 65nm.

This has commonly led to situations where the models that can be deployed in an edge environment are significantly smaller than state-of-the-art models leading the benchmark scoreboards [1]. A flash-based Analog Matrix Processor (AMP) is well positioned to close this development\/deployment gap by providing edge inference compute that is 10-to-100 more efficient than traditional digital inference.

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are an ideal application for the AMP since they can use analog-aware training to overcome the inherent non-idealities present in analog signal chains.

To conserve system energy, high-power devices stay dormant and are woken up only when an event is detected by a low-power always-on detector: which can be implemented by analog compute in memory (ACIM). However, there is a tradeoff between the inference accuracy and analog nonideality for ACIM designs, limiting the applicable AIoT applications. Current-domain [1] and time-domain [2] MACs show attractive energy efficiency since the area and parasitic capacitance are minimized from the compactly arranged unit cells. However, due to the large mismatch and nonlinearity of the unit cell, overall linearity is limited and is sensitive to PVT. The charge-sharing MAC [3] achieves PVT-insensitive linear 1bIN 1bW accumulation. However, expanding the IN and W precision from multiple 1bIN 1bW MACs and digital bit shifting which is also known as bit-wise causes large INL and noise discontinuities, due to a lack of inter-MSB\/LSB conversion's error correction margin. Besides, energy consumption is multiplied by reusing the 1b hardware. To overcome random noise, this work implements an error desensitization algorithm by training the VWW detector with the ACIM noise model. When the noise-aware error desensitization algorithm is used in a visual-wake-word (VWW) detector, the noise requirement for ACIM is relaxed by  2 , while still achieving the same inference accuracy. To overcome static gain, offset, and linearity a PVT-insensitive 8b word-wise ACIM is proposed.

SNR at low-light conditions, which is a key performance metric, is determined by the sensitivity and crosstalk in pixels. To improve sensitivity, pixel technology has migrated from frontside illumination (FSI) to backside illumiation (BSI) as pixel size shrinks down. In BSI technology, it is very difficult to further increase the sensitivity in a pixel of near-1.0m size because there are no structural obstacles for incident light from micro-lens to photodiode. Therefore the only way to improve low-light SNR is to reduce crosstalk, which makes the non-diagonal elements of the color-correction matrix (CCM) close to zero and thus reduces color noise [3]. The best way to improve crosstalk is to introduce a complete physical isolation between neighboring pixels, e.g., using deep-trench isolation (DTI). So far, a few attempts using DTI have been made to suppress silicon crosstalk. A backside DTI in as small as 1.12m-pixel, which is formed in the BSI process, is reported in [4], but it is just an intermediate step in the DTI-related technology because it cannot completely prevent silicon crosstalk, especially for long wavelengths of light. On the other hand, front-side DTIs for FSI pixels [5] and BSI pixels [6] are reported. In [5], however, DTI is present not only along the periphery of each pixel, but also invades into the pixel so that it is inefficient in terms of gathering incident light and providing sufficient amount of photodiode area. In [6], the pixel size is as large as 2.0m and it is hard to scale down with this technology for near 1.0m pitch because DTI width imposes a critical limit on the sufficient amount of photodiode area for full-well capacity. Thus, a new technological advance is necessary to realize the ideal front DTI in a small size pixel near 1.0m.","source":"ISSCC","title":"7.1 A 1\/4-inch 8Mpixel CMOS image sensor with 3D backside-illuminated 1.12m pixel with front-side deep-trench isolation and vertical transfer gate"}},{"docId":"2222","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Augmented reality (AR) is being investigated in advanced displays for the augmentation of images in a real-world environment.

Recently, research efforts have been made to realize bio-inspired artificial compound eyes to mimic the wide field of view (FoV) of insect visual organs by implementing photoreceptors to independently face different angles [1-2]. However, these approaches have drawbacks. They use complicated fabrication processes to form a hemispherical lens configuration and secure an independent optical path to each photoreceptor. We take a simple and practical approach to realize wide-field optic flow sensing in a pseudo-hemispherical configuration by mounting a number of 2D array optic flow sensors on a flexible PCB module as shown in Figure 7.2.1. In this scheme, the 2D optic flow sensor should meet the requirements of MAV applications: extremely low power consumption while maintaining robust optic flow generation. Conventional optic flow algorithms, such as Lucas-and-Kanade, require huge amounts of numerical calculations; therefore, they require substantial digital hardware (CPU and\/or FPGA), resulting in large power consumption [3-4]. As an alternative approach for low-power implementation, bio-inspired elementary motion detector (EMD) based algorithms (or neuromorphic algorithms) have been studied and implemented in analog VLSI circuits for autonomous navigation [5-6]. However, pure analog signal processing is easily susceptible to temperature and process variations and it is difficult to scale the pixel size or apply low-power design techniques because extensive analog processing is implemented in pixel-level circuits. In this work, we have devised and implemented a time-stamp-based optic flow algorithm, which is modified from the conventional EMD algorithm to give an optimum partitioning of hardware blocks in analog and digital domains as well as assign adequate allocation of pixel-level, column-parallel, and chip-level processing. Temporal filtering, which may require huge hardware resources if implemented in the digital domain, remains in a pixel-level analog processing unit. Feature detection is implemented using digital circuits that are column parallel. The embedded digital core decodes the 2D time-stamp information into velocity using chip-level processing.

Conventional papers report on research and development of 8K ultra-high-definition television (UHDTV) systems, 8K full-resolution cameras [1], and 8K 240fps cameras that employ stacked sensors [2]. In these camera systems, a rolling-shutter method is used for scanning, since a global-shutter method has an area tradeoff between the photoelectric conversion region and the charge storage region [3-5]. However, this leads to a shutter distortion problem during the high-speed imaging and synchronization of multi-viewpoint imaging. To overcome this problem, a CMOS image sensor is developed that has an 8K4k resolution, a 60fps frame rate, and a 450ke -  saturation signal, with an organic photoconductive film (OPF) laminated on the pixel circuits. Even with small (e.g., 3) pixels, a global shutter can be realized without degradation of the saturation signal [6]. However, there still remains a requirement to achieve 8K4K resolution at 60fps readout speed. There are three potential strategies to achieve this: 1) high-speed cancellation of reset noise in single storage-type global shutter pixels, 2) high-speed readout with a long vertical signal line, and 3) high-saturation in global-shutter mode. For 1), in the conventional case, a feedback amplifier (FBAMP) is allocated to each column to affect noise cancellation, but there is a long noise suppression time due to the large time constant of the vertical signal line. An in-pixel noise canceller is developed to shorten the noise suppression time even when the length of the vertical signal line becomes four times longer than with a Full High Definition (FHD) sensor. Moreover, to utilize the advantages of the OPF image sensor's stacked structure, high-capacitance Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) capacitors are allocated in the metal interconnect area. For 2), since the photoelectric conversion film is present at the upper layer, the photoelectric conversion characteristics are not affected, even if the number of vertical signal lines is increased. Therefore, two pairs of quadruple vertical signal lines are used for each vertical 8 pixels, and 16 sample-and-hold (S\/H) capacitors are provided in each column. For 3), a high saturation circuit is developed without increasing the pixel size.","source":"ISSCC","title":"An 8K4K-resolution 60fps 450ke-saturation-signal organic-photoconductive-film global-shutter CMOS image sensor with in-pixel noise canceller"}},{"docId":"3014","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Energy-efficient always-on motion-detection (MD) sensors are in high demand and are widely used in machine vision applications.

Event-based dynamic vision sensors (DVS) have been reported to reduce the redundant data and power through the asynchronous timestamped event-address readout [1], [2]. However, DVS needs special data processing to collect enough events for information extraction, and suffers from noise and dynamic effects, which limits the advantages of low-latency pixel event reporting. Furthermore, low sensitivity (no integration) and lack of static information are also drawbacks of DVS. Frame-based MD rolling-shutter sensors [3], [4] were reported to reduce the data bandwidth and power by sub-sampling operation with the tradeoff of low resolution and motion blur. Global-shutter MD sensors were reported [5], [6] using in-pixel analog memory for reference image storage. However, such sensors require a special process technology for low off-state current device implementation. In a frame-based MD sensor, the required analog processing circuit and two successive frames for temporal difference operation comes at a cost in power, area, and speed. To address these drawbacks, we present a frame-based MD vision sensor featuring three operation modes: image-capture (IC), frame-difference (FD) with on\/off event detection, and saliency-detection (SD).

Recent indirect ToF sensors have achieved continuous improvements in depth performance [1-4]. However, one of the issues with indirect ToF sensors is peak current during exposure time [1,2]. To solve the issue, current spreading can be adopted by driving each column group in a different time point; the resulting column fixed-pattern phase noise (FPPN) is compensated by time-interleaving two opposite-directional delay chains [2].

The biggest challenges with small pixels are to maintain dynamic range (DR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and sensitivity compatible with a sensor with larger pixels. A back-illuminated stacked sensor with front deep-trench isolation (FDTI) and shallow-trench isolation (STI) for inter-pixel and inter-node isolation respectively appears promising for continuous pixel-size reduction in terms of maximizing DR with large full-well capacity (FWC) while minimizing optical\/electrical crosstalk [3][5]. However, dark current may increase by strong electric fields (e-field) near defective FDTI interfaces if more doping is applied to a small photodiode (PD) to increase FWC. In addition, the FDTI\/STI structure limits the area of in-pixel transistor amplifiers, and it may deteriorate dark temporal noise (TN) as pixel pitch becomes smaller. Furthermore, optical crosstalk between different color filters (CFs) is more problematic as pixel size enters the sub-wavelength scale. In this work, a back-illuminated 64Mpixel CIS with  0.56m  -pitched pixels is reported.

Direct time-of-flight (ToF) systems based on CMOS image sensors (CIS) with avalanche photodiodes with the Geiger-mode or single-photon avalanche diodes (SPAD) have been developed for these purposes. One difficulty is to meet practical requirements of long-range (250m) measurement capability together with both lateral and depth resolution. Although indirect-ToF systems based on modulation and phase sensitive detection have fine depth resolution of the order of sub-cm, their full range is limited only to 4m with standard Si-photodiodes [1] and 20m with the gain assist of APD [2]. Direct-ToF systems based on SPAD pixels with time-to-digital converters (TDC) have long range measurement capability but have not reached megapixel resolution [3], [4]. Another direct-ToF of sub-range syntheses (SRS) system, which detects single photons returned from an object located in each sub-range by synchronous gating, was demonstrated to have a long range (250m) measurement capability with high lateral resolution of 10cm. However, it has a depth resolution limited by the width of optical pulse source [5]. In order to circumvent this issue, in this work, we develop an SRS-ToF system based on a 6m pitch, 1200900pixels, Geiger-mode operated vertical avalanche photodiodes (VAPD) CIS that enables one to configure depth resolution down to 10cm for short-distance (<; 20m) ranging by building an indirect-ToF system on the previous one [5], where a capability for long-distance (250m) ranging with a lateral resolution of 10cm is preserved. The full range comprising 15 subranges is measured in real time (30fps) with a 450fps speed of each subrange capture. Charge packets of Geiger-mode pulses accumulated on an in-pixel charge accumulator (ICA) are converted to a precise photon-count-image by a single-slope analog-to-digital converter (SSADC). In addition, by phase differentiating accumulated Geiger-mode charge on the ICA, resolving the near side of a sub-range down to 10cm is demonstrated. Thus, a Geiger-mode ToF system capable of imaging a frame with direct-indirect mixed subranges by a single CIS chip is achieved.","source":"ISSCC","title":"5.2 A 1200900 6m 450fps Geiger-Mode Vertical Avalanche Photodiodes CMOS Image Sensor for a 250m Time-of-Flight Ranging System Using Direct-Indirect-Mixed Frame Synthesis with Configurable-Depth-Resolution Down to 10cm"}},{"docId":"977","weight":0.7297734495573743,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"This is a report of a CMOS image sensor with a sub-pixel architecture having a pixel pitch of 3 um.

Due to battery cost and size, aggressive power reductions are crucial to make vision sensor nodes more inexpensive, smaller, and longer-lived (Fig. 5.7.1). Purely harvested imagers further reduce cost and size at unbounded lifespan, although imposing a tight peak power budget (e.g.,  Ws  for mm-scale solar cells). Accordingly, such imagers target ultra-low power\/pixel as a key efficiency metric, as opposed to the energy figure-of-merit (FOM) commonly adopted for battery-powered systems. Aggressive power reductions in low-cost CMOS imagers were recently achieved through fully digital time-domain readout schemes with low bit depth (e.g., 4 to 8b) [1], [2], although at a relatively high power\/pixel (1nW) [1], and without incorporating any higher-level function for routine scene\/event monitoring to filter out unimportant data and transmit\/process only when\/where strictly necessary [1], [2]. In- or near-sensor coupling of higher-level tasks was widely explored to reduce system power, as in computational imagers that efficiently compute features and few neural network layers for reduced subsequent transmission\/processing [3], [4]. Unfortunately, their higher power\/pixel pushes the overall imager power to tens or hundreds of  Ws  regardless of the importance of the scene content. To reduce system power, event detection\/recognition [5] (motion, simple object) and log-gradient extraction [6] have been embedded at 300 to 3,800pW\/pixel.

Among different TRNGs, quantum RNGs (QRNG) represent a good candidate for such systems, because of their compactness, low cost and performance [16]. They typically consist of a source of photons, such as an attenuated LED, coupled to a detector with single photon capability (SPAD). Many works in the literature have used a single detector [14] for random bit extraction. These devices are characterized by a limited bit rate [1], which can be increased by exploiting the arrival time of photons at the cost of circuit and system complexity [24]. Recent works [56] proposed to implement an array of detectors based on SPAD working in parallel thus extending the speed of QRNG up to 5 Gb\/s [5]. Despite the high bit rate, the main drawback of [5] is the strong dependence of each pixel bias on the impinging light intensity which forces the system to work only for a narrow range of photon flux that poses several constraints on the design of the final QRNG system, e.g. the need of a feedback control loop to maintain a constant flux of photons, and of a uniform distribution of light over the entire sensor. Moreover, it is impractical to implement algorithms for bit extraction to all detectors of the array because of different responses and mismatches among SPADs.","source":"ISSCC","title":"16.3 A 1616 pixels SPAD-based 128-Mb\/s quantum random number generator with 74dB light rejection ratio and 6.7ppm\/C bias sensitivity on temperature"}},{"docId":"1245","weight":0.619414412551866,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Recent progress of Back-illuminated CMOS image sensor (BI-CIS), focusing on their pixel improvements with design of optical properties using subwavelength sizescale structures and photonics technologies, are reviewed.

Coded exposure (CE) is one of the methods applied in intelligent systems approaches, and various functions can be realized by the selection of the integration variable in the plenoptic function. High DR can be realized if the integration variable is time. A variety of means to achieve high DR have been proposed in the literature, for example, a method that provides a plurality of detection capacitors (LOFIC,) or a method of preventing saturation by adding low-sensitivity pixels. These methods often require an enlarged pixel size. Alternatively, high-speed readout like an array parallel stacked structure is useful for integrating multiple frames to realize high DR. However, this leads to an increase in noise and needs faster readout to reduce motion artifacts. In order to mitigate the adverse effects, a method has been proposed in which a pixel array is divided into a plurality of blocks and the signal integration time of each block is individually controlled. Another method was described in which CE was demonstrated by using pixel level control of the exposure time. However, in these methods, it was necessary to arrange the readout path and control circuitry within the same plane because these are non-stacked sensors, so the pixel size was relatively large and high resolution was difficult to realize.

A single-antenna FMCW radar is more compact, but more difficult to implement than a two-antenna one. On-chip in-band full duplexers (IBFDs) with a self-interference cancellation mechanism can support general integrated single-antenna wireless systems [4-6]. For the specific application of a FMCW radar, a duplex RF front-end without the complexity of on-chip IBFDs has been proposed. With it, an integrated FMCW radar is allowed to transmit and receive simultaneously via a single antenna. In this work, an integrated X-band FMCW radar chip is implemented in 65nm CMOS and a wireless demonstration of the radar chip is presented.","source":"ISSCC","title":"18.3 A single-port duplex RF front-end for X-band single-antenna FMCW radar in 65nm CMOS"}},{"docId":"2636","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Radar sensors find use in a wide range of applications [14].

High-efficiency integrated CMOS power amplifiers (PA) are highly desirable for portable devices for improved battery life, reduced form factor, and low cost. To meet simultaneous requirements for high efficiency and reasonable linearity, PAs intended for use with complex modulation are often operated in Class-AB mode [1,2]. For small input amplitude in Class-AB, the device is turned-on and has an input capacitance (C gs ) of (2\/3)WLC ox . As the input amplitude becomes large, the device turns-off for part of the RF cycle, thus reducing its effective input capacitance. This input capacitance-modulation effect creates an input-amplitude-dependent phase shift in Class-AB mode resulting in an amplitude-modulation to phase-modulation (AM-PM) distortion [2]. Consequently, it degrades linearity metrics (e.g., error vector magnitude (EVM), adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR)) in complex-modulation systems. External linearization techniques (e.g., digital pre-distortion) are often used in transmitters to meet linearity requirements, but they are complex in nature and expensive to implement. Apart from these, few works at low-GHz frequencies are reported to improve the PA's intrinsic linearity using a varactor-or PMOS-based AM-PM correction methods [1,2].

To create this 2D array of distributed frequency and phase-locked sources, prior works have shown central LO-signal distribution with local harmonic upconversion [3]. However, this requires high power consumption in the LO distribution. In addition, phase-matching with PVT variations across the sources at the harmonic-radiating THz frequency can be quite challenging. A small  perturbation at the fundamental frequency translates to N at the radiated N th  harmonic, thus corrupting the array beam pattern. Another method to synchronize multiple distributed radiating sources (\/2 spaced at Nfo) is through a mutual coupling network with active\/passive elements in a coupled oscillator array [4], [5]. However, the locking range in these methods is typically narrow (f locking  f 0 \/20 to f 0 \/10) and PVT variations can easily cause desynchronization. In such a network, each cell is a self-sustaining oscillator, and the coupling network tries to establish injection signals to force synchronization between these individual free-running oscillators.

Moreover, most previous works [3-5] are based on conventional transceiver architectures that use separate antennas for TX and RX or use parallel multi-antenna designs to increase the frequency bandwidth [1]. These structures not only increase the chip size but also degrade the radar performance when they are placed at the focal point of a collimating lens. This degradation occurs due to the separated antenna phase centers, which are not well located at the collimating lens focal point, causing a multi-beam radiation pattern. To overcome these challenges, we have adopted an autodyne FMCW radar structure [6,7] with a phase processing method on the radar IF signal [7]. The autodyne is an oscillator that simultaneously carries out functions of generating the transmission and mixing the transmitted and reflected signals. There is no separate path for the RX signal in the autodyne, as the radiated and reflected signals exist at the same point of the autodyne circuit. Hence, it utilizes a combined antenna with a single-phase center for both transmitting and receiving parts. Besides, the phase processing method allows us to measure short ranges with an error no more than one-tenth of one-percent, which in terahertz frequencies provides micrometer resolutions [7].

A THz signal source is indispensable for applications in the mid-THz band. However, this band is beyond the  f_max  of most silicon-based technologies, making high-power signal generation extremely challenging. Coupled oscillator-radiator array architecture is prevalent for coherent THz signal generation and radiation [25]. The radiation beam narrows as the array size increases, implying a double boost in ElRP. However, most reported arrays are limited in size. Thus, the output power is small, and high ElRPs are realized by the expensive and bulky external silicon lenses [35]. A large array reported in [4] is  6 7  in size but only radiates -10.9dBm at 1.01THz. Increasing the array size is not trivial. An on-chip patch-antenna-based source [2] is preferred as it can remove the silicon lens and better dissipate heat to avoid the thermal compression compared to the designs radiating from the silicon substrate [35]. The multi-layer topology in [2] can produce a beamforming function but lowers the DC-to-THz conversion efficiency at 416GHz.

Today, multi-chip radar cascading solutions use mm-wave LO frequencies (20GHz [1], [2], 40GHz [3]) along with on-chip frequency multipliers with modest multiplication factors (4 [1], [2], 2 [3]). However, operating at these frequencies is cost-prohibitive and severely limits the size of the array [1]. For example, for a 64-TX and 64-RX array, the calculated path loss on a Rogers 3003 substrate in an H-tree distribution network reaches 87dB at 40GHz, which requires more than 70 amplifiers with 15dBm output power and 25dB gain alongside the distribution network to compensate the loss. Moreover, maintaining phase coherency required for FMCW systems is also infeasible for such amplifier implementations.

As shown in [1], a 4mm physical separation between TRX antennas at 122GHz can cause 6 TRX beam misalignment, exceeding the 3dB beamwidth of the 29dBi-directivity beam. Monostatic radars are, therefore, preferred in those applications, when sufficient TRX isolation is achieved to avoid saturating the RX.

In [3], such extra loss is mitigated through two sets of hybrid couplers and a quad-feed circularly polarized antenna.

Unfortunately, most previous works are based on incoherent direct detection (Fig. 25.5.1), which causes low sensitivity due to the output droping quickly with input power (VRF2), and, as a result, need exceedingly high power sources for illumination. This problem can be alleviated by utilizing coherent heterodyne detection scheme (Fig. 25.5.1), in which the terahertz input (RF) mixes with a local oscillation (LO) signal and generates an output with the amplitude proportional to VRFVLO. As the LO power is normally significantly higher than RF, the sensitivity is much enhanced. Moreover, as the output also carries the RF phase information (RF), digital beamforming is achievable. For a better comparison, an NPN transistor is configured both as a direct detector (input power injected from the emitter) and a heterodyne detector (-20dBm LO power pumped into the base). The simulated output current with different input power is shown in Fig. 25.5.1, in which we observe a sensitivity enhancement of more than 40dB.

Furthermore, 5G mm-wave systems typically employ spectrally efficient modulation schemes with high peak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs). This requirement demands the TX power amplifier (PA) to operate in power back-off (PBO), thus degrading its average efficiency. To alleviate this issue, outphasing or Doherty PAs (DPAs) can be adopted [1-4]. However, as depicted in Fig. 14.4.1 (Top left), these efficiency-enhancement techniques will worsen the output reflection coefficient of the PA ( PA ). Consequently, the unwanted element-to-element coupled signal reflects back to the antenna and will deteriorate the phased-array beam pattern and its TX linearity. A previously promoted solution for this antenna VSWR problem is load mismatch detection, followed by tuning of the output matching network (self-healing). However, this requires the use of a reconfigurable and inevitably lossy matching network [5].

While independently radiating, each element is also unidirectionally connected to its neighboring elements in both horizontal and vertical directions through variable phase shifters, row and col, respectively. This network is inherently scalable because it only relies on couplings with the nearest neighbors and there is no high-frequency global routing to any oscillator. The purpose of this topology is twofold: first to synchronize all the oscillators to a single frequency and next, to set a desired phase shift between the adjacent elements (row and col).

To ensure sufficient link budget under mm-wave path losses, array-based systems are required. However, element coupling in practical antenna arrays varies each antenna load from its ideal  50  impedance (i.e., VSWR = 1). Power amplifiers (PAs) govern the overall transmitter (Tx) performance yet are the most susceptible blocks to VSWR variation, as they interface directly with antennas. The antenna VSWR alters the PA load, degrading the PA linearity, efficiency, output power, and reliability. Multiple proposed reconfigurable PAs maintain the PA performance under VSWR but require VSWR resilient built-in-self-test (BiST), particularly on-chip power and impedance sensors, to determine the PA operation\/reconfiguration. Previous work on power detectors is primarily based on voltage sensing, which only tracks the true RF power for a fixed and known real load. The works in [1] and [2] detect both load current and voltage to measure the real RF power over VSWR. However, both only properly operate for differential PAs, while most mm-wave front-end\/antenna interfaces require single-ended connections. Meanwhile, reported impedance detectors consist of either an equivalent passive series element or shunt element with large capacitive loading [3][5]. These designs inevitably add loss, limit the PA output-matching-network (OMN) bandwidth (BW), and change the OMN impedance transformation.

Allocated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Europe Conference of Postal and Telecommunications (CEPT), the 71-to-76GHz and 81-to-86GHz bands (i.e., the E-band), enable the multi-Gb\/s wireless communications [1]. The mm-wave CMOS RF digital-to-analog converters (RFDACs) [25] with merits of high system efficiency (SE), simplified system architecture with directly digital modulation, high data-rate, and low cost have drawn great attention. However, the maximal data-rates of these RFDACs are lower than 8Gb\/s. To support higher data-rate (e.g., more than 10Gb\/s) for E-band applications, high-order modulation signals with large bandwidth must be supported. High sampling frequency is required for RFDACs to achieve large modulation bandwidth, which is limited by the switching speed of transistors. Meanwhile, large dynamic range is needed to support high-order modulation signals, which are usually deteriorated by significant local oscillator (LO) leakage at mm-wave. In addition, high output power  (P_out)  is demanded for high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and large coverage in wireless transmission [6].

Due to the limited  f_T\/f_max  of transistors, direct THz generation using a fundamental oscillator is not feasible; therefore, various approaches have been developed based on harmonic extraction and the frequency multiplication of a fundamental oscillator [2]. In these techniques, the nonlinearity of transistors is utilized to generate higher harmonics from a fundamental oscillator or frequency-multiplier cells; however, such systems have a poor efficiency and low radiated power due to device limitations. To compensate for the low generated power, a coherent array scheme is preferred to increase EI RP and radiated power. Adjusting the phase and locking the frequency of elements for coherent operation are important factors in array architectures, which can be performed through central LO distribution [3] and mutual coupling [4]. LO distribution can cause phase mismatch between elements and significantly increases the DC power consumption by adding more blocks. Mutual coupling through injection locking can maintain phase alignment. However, this type of coupling has low tuning range, which makes it challenging to synchronize elements over a broad frequency range. In this work, a technique for THz CW generation is presented, in which, instead of relying on transistor nonlinearity, a PIN diode is used in the reverse recovery mode for strong harmonic generation. A PIN diode, similar to a step recovery diode (SRD), benefits from a sharp reverse recovery and is highly nonlinear in the recovery mode, which enables efficient THz harmonic generation by upconverting the output of a mm-wave oscillator without requiring additional blocks and multipliers. The PIN-based array consists of 2x3 elements, where differential Colpitts oscillators are used as the core to push the PIN diodes into reverse recovery.

In addition, since the small satellites cannot have the large-size antenna installed on the main body, a deployable membrane is attached to the main body for the large phased-array antenna.

This functionality is paramount for communications-on-the-move applications, wireless link discovery, and rapid beam alignment\/tracking at mm-wave and THz frequencies [2]-[9]. The current protocols for direction finding and beam alignment in 5G mm-wave systems are based on iterative algorithms that are often non-scalable, time-consuming, and computationally expensive, posing serious challenges for low-latency applications. Thus there is a need to process such direction-finding methods at the `edge nodes', to enable secure scalable networks with very low latencies [10].

The three-level topology applies three different voltages, V in  1\/2V in  and V SS , to the node V X . The operation mode is determined by the duty cycle, i.e., the node V x  swings between 1\/2V in  and V SS  when duty cycle (D <; 0.5), and between 1\/2V in  and V in , otherwise (D>0.5). In state-of-the-art , the key issue of the three-level topology is how to balance the cross voltage of flying capacitor C FLY  at the point of 1\/2V in . In general, the restrained output voltage ripple and the flatter inductor current (I L ) slope seriously result in worse transient response and severe cross-regulation (CR) problems, respectively. Results show that the three-level SITO converter achieves a smaller output voltage ripple in steady state, but it causes the problems of slower transient response time, longer recovery time, larger overshoot\/undershoot, and severe CR.

The SRC controls on\/off time of the power MOSFETs M1-M4 and the output switches SO1-SO3 synchronously where the cross voltage of CFLY is adjusted by the AFC in case of any load changes. Based on the output voltage variation, the CFLY controller of the AFC regulates the load-dependent cross voltage across the CFLY which increases the inductor current slope for fast transient response with a controllable closed loop. On the other hand, for the steady state, the CFLY controller adjusts the cross voltage to 1\/2 V in  to minimize the output voltage ripple and achieve high efficiency. Thus, the three-level topology reduces the output voltage ripple, the AFC technique not only speeds up the transient response but also reduces the CR.

Each mobile device is usually equipped with a Li-ion battery having voltage that varies from a minimum of 2.7V to a maximum of 4.2V. Therefore, as the battery voltage decreases with time, a DC-DC converter is required for a regulated supply lower or higher than the battery voltage. A simple buck converter is not suited for this case, since step-up conversion is not available [1]. Instead, a non-inverting buck-boost converter can be a solution over the entire range of the battery voltage [1-4]. Many research studies related to buck-boost converters operated on Li-ion batteries set the target output voltage at around 3.4V [3,4]. Since Li-ion batteries have a wide plateau from 3.6V to 3.8V and a small energy storage below the plateau, DC-DC converters are generally operated on step-down mode at most of the battery voltage range, as shown in Fig. 10.4.1 top. Notwithstanding, step-up conversion is also required for extracting the energy below the plateau even if it is a small amount in the battery. Therefore, in DC-DC converters, it is critical to maintain high efficiency over the whole range of the battery voltage when it operates on both step-down and step-up modes to prolong the battery usage effectively.

The conventional close-loop driving solution dynamically senses the PT's impedance, executes the power-factor correction (PFC), and tracks the target resonance . However, the complex sensing causes delay and does not fit for drastic load changing. The BPO method utilizes the PT's intrinsic nature as the bandpass filter, automatically captures the dominant resonance, and features a simpler architecture with less hardware cost. For power regulation, Loop II is a current-fed DC-AC converter with an enhanced SMC that achieves high regulation accuracy for steady-state and fast response for large load transition. Loop III utilizes a phase-locked loop (PLL) to discriminate the non-longitudinal modes in the time-domain, and prevents the scalpels from being stuck. This method features higher sensitivity than the conventional filter based approach. Compared with the discrete solutions, the monolithic integration reduces the delay of Loop I and enhances the Q and resonant efficiency. Moreover, the conventional bulky system with discrete mainframe box can be integrated into the scalpel's handler, improving the feasibility for the minimum invasive surgery.","source":"ISSCC","title":"21.4 A reduced-order sliding-mode controller with an auxiliary PLL frequency discriminator for ultrasonic electric scalpels"}},{"docId":"2701","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"With more and more functions in modern battery-powered mobile devices, enabling light-harvesting in the power management system can extend battery usage time [1]. For both indoor and outdoor operations of mobile devices, the output power range of the solar panel with the size of a touchscreen can vary from 100s of W to a Watt due to the irradiance-level variation. An energy harvester is thus essential to achieve high maximum power-point tracking efficiency ( T ) over this wide power range. However, state-of-the-art energy harvesters only use one maximum power-point tracking (MPPT) method under different irradiance levels as shown in Fig. 22.5.1 [2-5]. Those energy harvesters with power-computation-based MPPT schemes for portable [2,3] and standalone [4] systems suffer from low  T  under low input power due to the limited input dynamic range of the MPPT circuitry. Other low-power energy harvesters with the fractional open-cell voltage (FOCV) MPPT scheme are confined by the fractional-constant accuracy to only offer high  T  across a narrow power range [5]. Additionally, the conventional FOCV MPPT scheme requires long transient time of 250ms to identify MPP [5], thereby significantly reducing energy capture from the solar panel. To address the above issues, this paper presents an energy harvester with an irradiance-aware hybrid algorithm (IAHA) to automatically switch between an auto-zeroed pulse-integration based MPPT (AZ PI-MPPT) and a slew-rate-enhanced FOCV (SRE-FOCV) MPPT scheme for maximizing  T  under different irradiance levels. The SRE-FOCV MPPT scheme also enables the energy harvester to shorten the MPPT transient time to 2.9ms in low irradiance levels.","source":"ISSCC","title":"22.5 A 93"}},{"docId":"2771","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Harvesting energy from ambient vibrations with piezoelectric transducers is an alternative solution for the surging needs of self-powered devices, such as IoT devices, condition and structural monitoring devices, or biomedical implants.

A conventional voltage-mode receiver (VM-RX) uses a rectifier or a doubler for AC-DC conversion [1,2]. This requires a sufficiently large input power (P, N ) inducing a large voltage (V AC ) in the LC tank of the receiver (RX) due to the limited voltage conversion efficiency. A subordinate DC-DC converter is also required for voltage regulation or battery charging, which reduces the overall power-conversion efficiency (PCE) due to the 2-stage structure. To overcome these limitations, the resonant current-mode receiver (RCM-RX) has been proposed for direct battery charging [3] and voltage regulation [4,5]. The RCM-RX has two operation phases: a resonance phase (PH re ) that accumulates energy in the LC tank during optimal resonant cycles (N OPT ) to track the maximum efficiency [3], and a charging phase (PH ch ) that delivers the energy of the LC tank to the output, when the resonant current (I AC ) is at its peak. However, the RCM-RX typically operates at low resonant frequency f RESO  (50kHz to 1MHz) because it is challenging to accurately detect the peak timing of I AC  due to the intrinsic delay and offset of the comparator used in the peak timing detector. Operating at low f RESO  causes the coil size to increase, making a burden on a size-constrained implant. In addition, the RCM-RX has a LC-tank resonance-loss interval PH ch , which hinders optimal power transfer from the transmitter (TX) to the RX because the reactive impedance is not cancelled out but appears on the TX side. Because the LC tank and the output are not isolated during PH ch , the power-transfer efficiency (PTE) can also be affected by load variation, such as the battery-voltage (V BAT ) variation. These problems become worse as N OPT  is reduced to lower number.","source":"ISSCC","title":"A 13.56MHz time-interleaved resonant-voltage-mode wireless-power receiver with isolated resonator and quasi-resonant boost converter for implantable systems"}},{"docId":"2822","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"The session on Power Converter Techniques presents improvements of power density, power efficiency and power dissipation in switched-capacitor, hybrid, linear and inductor-based DC-DC converters and power modulators.

In addition, it is difficult for an on-chip-capacitor-based power-transfer system to achieve high isolation voltage and high output power at the same time with a reasonable silicon area. Coreless-micro-transformer-based power-transfer systems [2]-[3] operate at 160 to 330MHz with coil inductance of 10s of nH.

Among hybrid topologies, 3-level [2] and double step-down (DSD) topologies [3] are popular examples, as shown in Fig. 11.1.1.

When  increases to  90^ , the grade of coupling expressed by the coupling factor k decreases to zero. At the same time, the communication strength is weakened between the RX and the TX sense coil, which is connected in parallel with the TX main coil, and is easily affected by noise. Through the TX2 coil perpendicular to TX1, the RX can still receive energy in case  changes. However, when TX2 sense coil takes over the charging control, it does not have any communication with the TX1, causing power loss. Therefore, this paper proposes a three dimension (3D) WPT system with the ability of controlling X, Y, and Z axes coils through the central controller (bottom left of Fig. 30.8.1). The central controller communicates with the three TXs in the vector detection control loop. Since the RX changes position in 3D relative to each TX, the central controller needs to detect the vector of RX based on the position of each TX. Although the k sensor in [3] can extract the coupling coefficient [4], the coupling factor in 3D is still a problem. Thus, the vector detector loop is proposed to determine the k factor for each TX in 3D. The central controller will decide the power distribution of each TX and effectively control the power transfer of the TX for high efficiency. To ensure the communication between the RX and each TX will not be affected by ambient noise and interference from the adjacent TXs, the noise cancellation technique is proposed (bottom right of Fig. 30.8.1). If communication is established in the communication main coil, the induced magnetic flux in the auxiliary coil will enhance the received signal. Conversely, if communication is not established, the induced magnetic flux in the auxiliary coil will cancel the signal received in the communication main coil for noise cancellation.

However, in practice, ML converters suffer from a flying capacitor  (C_F)  voltage  (V_CF)  imbalance due to the parasitic capacitance  (C_par)  and gate driving power  (P_GD) , etc., which causes not only large conduction losses  (P_COND)  in the on-resistance  (R_ON)  of the SWs and the parasitic resistance  (R_L)  of the inductor (L), but also a large overlap loss and damage to the SWs. For these reasons, a  V_CF  calibration  (V_CF-cal)  technique is essential to the ML converter. In particular, unlike a ML buck converter, MLBST requires the faster  V_CF -cal because the  V_CF 's reference voltage  (V_CF,REF)  is  V_0  which can vary abruptly. For the  V_CF  balance, prior works [1], [2] adjusted the duration of the  C_F  charging and discharging phase  (_CH,_DIS)  using two mismatched duties  (D_1,D_2)  modulated by the calibration loop. However, that caused sub-harmonic oscillations in the inductor current  (I_L) , which enlarged  P_COND  in  R_L  proportional to the frequency. In addition, the bandwidth (BW) limit of the  V_CF -cal loop by the  V_0  control loop and the repetitive  _CH  and  _DIS  every cycle cause difficulty of immediate  V_CF cal in the start-up (Fig. 30.5.1, top left). Since it can result in breakdown and reliability issues for transistors, it is hard to mass produce the MLBST. Moreover, for the stability of the  V_CF -cal loop, an additional compensator that uses bulky passive components is necessary. Another structure that does not depend on the  V_CF -cal loop was proposed, but it needed an additional capacitor and incurred a surge current with redistribution losses due to the repetitive capacitor hard charging [3] (Fig. 30.5.1, middle left). Meanwhile, in power converters, the current mode control (CMC) is preferred thanks to the fast dynamic performance, over current protection, etc. But it is hard to apply it to the MLBST because of the mode transition issue. In the 3-level (3L) BST, there are two operation modes, mode-1  (_M1)  and mode-2  (_M2) .

Due to the usage of high voltage switches, the need for small font factor and multiple outputs for high power density power management becomes imperative in Internet-of-Things (loT) electronics. Thus, single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) converters (top left of Fig. 11.4.1) become one of the best candidates due to its dual outputs with the use of a single inductor [1][3]. However, the bulky inductor determined by the maximum current driving capability is not efficient at light loads. In addition, SIDO converters also suffer from large output voltage ripple due to its discontinuous energy deliver to the outputs. The double step down (DSD) converter, with two small inductors and one flying capacitor, not only reduces the voltage stress of each component but also increases power density (top right of Fig. 11.4.1) [4][6]. However, if dual outputs are required, double components are required. To take advantages of SIDO and DSD converters, this paper presents the DSD dual-output (DSD-DO) converter for loT electronics (bottom left of Fig. 11.4.1). This converter only requires one 48V device and three 24V devices, while the rest of the switches are 5V devices. In the main energy transfer path (bottom right of Fig. 11.4.1), two small inductors L1 and L2 supply energy to V OA  and V OB , respectively, through operation Path 1, and to V OB  and V OA , respectively, through operation Path 2. Since both V OA  and V OB  can draw energy from  V_IN  during majority of the switching cycle, the output voltage ripple can be effectively reduced in steady state. Each inductor current of the DSD-DO is half of that in the SIDO [1][3], which reduces conduction loss and output voltage ripple  (V_OA(B)) . Conventional DSD [5] has a serious problem with inductor current imbalance from different inductor current slopes. That is,  m_L1,up  for L1 is greater than  m_L2,up  for L2 due to an extra switch in the flying capacitor  C_F  discharge loop, resulting in uneven voltage ripple and potential hot spot issues. Through the proposed timing balance mechanism (TBM), the duration of Path 1 and Path 2 can be adjusted according to the output load currents  I_OA  and  I_OB , which balances the two inductor currents. Therefore, low output voltage ripple can be guaranteed at both outputs. To further alleviate the cross-regulation problem in SIDO when the load changes from light to heavy, the Hybrid Sum and Deviation (HSD) technique is presented. This technique controls the auxiliary energy transfer path, which can boost the droop voltages of  V_OA  and  V_OB  to their regulation voltages via Path 3 and Path 4, respectively (bottom right corner of Fig. 11.4.1).","source":"ISSCC","title":"11.4 A Double Step-Down Dual-Output Converter with Cross Regulation of 0.025mV\/mA and Improved Current Balance"}},{"docId":"2910","weight":0.7297016016500207,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Electromagnetic vibration energy harvesters (EMHs) can harvest mW-range power from sub-g vibrational environments while having a volume of a few cm 3 , Thus, such EMHs are promising candidates for powering net-zero-power sensor nodes as compared to their electrostatic- or piezoelectric-based counterpars [1], [2], especially in the industrial environments (e.g., harvesting energy from stator of motors or rotating wheels).","source":"ISSCC","title":"32.3 Electromagnetic Mechanical Energy-Harvester IC with No Off-Chip Component and One Switching Period MPPT Achieving up to 95.9"}},{"docId":"2739","weight":0.7292151381436709,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Multicore application processors in smartphones\/watches use power-saving techniques such as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) to extend battery cycle, and supply cores with different voltages [1].

To address this issue, synchronized-switch harvesting-on-inductor (SSHI) and synchronous electric-charge extraction (SECE) techniques have been proposed.

It is desirable to accommodate different energy sources (a wide input voltage  V_IN  range), together with a wide range of output voltage  V_OUT  range, from down-to-0.5V to up-to-2V (for button battery). Therefore, a buck-boost converter with high efficiency over a wide voltage conversion ratio (VCR) range is favorable. To reduce the volume and cost, switched-capacitor (SC) converters are in demand. However, a conventional SC only obtains good efficiency at discontinuous VCRs [1] (Fig. 30.7.1). This stems from the large voltage swing  ( V_CF)  on the flying capacitors  C_F  at non-optimum VCRs, leading to large charge sharing loss  (P_CSL)  and  C_F  bottom plate (BP) parasitic capacitance loss (proportional to   V_CF^2) . Multi-phase continuously scalable-conversion-ratio SC (CSC) converters [25] split the large   V_CF  into small steps, with the help of multiple internal voltage rails from the  C_F  of the adjacent phases, and the out-phasing technique [2]. For example, in a CSC step-down converter (Fig. 30.7.1), the  C_F  top plate (TP) in each phase connects to either  V_IN, V_OUT , or the  M  internal TP rails  (V_T1  to  V_TM) , while the bottom plate connects to either  V_OUT , ground  V_SS  or  N  internal BP rails  (V_B1 to V_BN)  . Then the  V_CF  step is   V_T  when TP connects to an internal rail:   V_T=(V_IN-V_OUT)\/(2M+1) . Likewise, the  V_CF  step becomes   V_B  when BP connects to an internal rail:   V_B=V_OUT\/(2N+1) . This reduces the  P_CSL  and BP parasitic losses at non-optimum VCRs, and hence allows a high efficiency over a continuous VCR range. The CSC step-up converter [3] shares the same benefit. Yet, with a fixed  M+N  value (amount of resources consumed), once at a non-optimum VCR, e.g.  V_OUT  becomes small, the reduction in   V_B  is too small such that the efficiency improvement is negligible, while the increased   V_T  degrades the efficiency greatly, as shown in Fig. 30.7.1.","source":"ISSCC","title":"A Continuously Scalable-Conversion-Ratio SC Converter with Reconfigurable VCF Step for High Efficiency over an Extended VCR Range"}},{"docId":"2647","weight":0.6524261840506226,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Wireless power transmission (WPT) via inductive coupling is used in many applications such as biomedical implants, sensors, and radio-frequency identification (RFID).

Conventionally, an opto-coupler is used to feedback the compensation signal from the secondary side (SS) to the primary side (PS) of the power transformer. To avoid drawbacks of the opto-coupler, such as current transfer ratio (CTR) variation with temperature\/aging and the lower frequency bandwidth, the magnetic feedback with a small pulse transformer is utilized to replace the opto-coupler. To improve the power conversion efficiency higher than the quasi-resonance (QR) flyback approach [3] while not increasing the number of components and the cost, for example by using GaN devices or active clamp circuit [4]-[6], a technique to achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS) at the PS switch by auxiliary turn-on of the synchronous rectifier (SR) at the SS is used [7]. The commercially available USB PD flyback converter solutions use an external USB PD controller IC and external shunt-regulator-based loop compensation. To reduce the number of external components and make the power adaptor more compact, the proposed IC further integrates the USB PD controller and the CV\/CC loop compensator with the internal programmable proportional-integral compensator (IPPIC).","source":"ISSCC","title":"18.5 ZVS Flyback-Converter ICs Optimizing USB Power Delivery for Fast-Charging Mobile Devices to Achieve 93.5"}},{"docId":"2480","weight":0.5434927868415954,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Energy harvesting is an attractive solution to extend system lifetime for internet of everything (IoE) nodes.

However, the thermal issue becomes the limiting factor for fast charging an extremely compact portable device. How to move the heat out of the device, meanwhile keeping the device small and thin, becomes a question of great concern. An integrated charger involves a switching power converter, in which the power inductor is one of the main sources of power loss, besides occupying the largest area. To address this problem, an attractive solution is to relocate the power inductor in a DC-DC converter from the high-current output side to the low-current input side [13]. Such inductor-first topologies considerably reduce the average current on the inductor, and thus allowing the use of a smaller one. Furthermore, moving the inductor to the input side also allow the replacement of the discrete inductor by the parasitic inductor of the USB cable [1], eliminating the need for any magnetics on-board, and reducing the on-board power dissipation. Thus far, prior solutions still put the power converter chip inside the portable devices, which means the generated heat is still inside the device. In addition, using this structure means that the power converter design should also take the cable type, length, and electrical characteristics into consideration for a closed-loop regulation.","source":"ISSCC","title":"A 42W Reconfigurable Bidirectional Power Delivery Voltage-Regulating Cable"}},{"docId":"3038","weight":0.531953287660392,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Todays miniLED displays can be divided into multiple arrays.

Since the inductor current I_L=I_LOAD\/(1-D) of the conventional 2-switch (2S) boost converter is high, where I_LOAD is the load current and D is the duty cycle, 2S boost converters have low efficiency and high output voltage ripple. Although the boost converter assisted by a series flying capacitor C_F can reduce the inductor current level to improve efficiency [1] [5], C_F lacks energy under high CR and high loading conditions. At the top of Fig. 17.9.1, both techniques in [1] and [2] charge the C_F during  2. ln case of high CR, the duration of  2 becomes small to seriously affect the charging time.

As the display is one of the modules that consumes the largest portion of the power in electronic devices, displays must be designed to operate with a higher efficiency to improve a battery longevity. As a means of supplying power to such displays, DC-DC converters and their performance are important. Along with high efficiency, a DC-DC converter should provide quiet supply voltages for the display to avoid light fluctuation [1]. For this reason, many devices use two separate DC-DC converters, boost and inverting buck-boost converters, to generate a positive (V op ) and a negative (V on ) output voltage, respectively [2], as shown in top-left of Fig. 11.6.1. Although this structure is advantageous for making quiet output voltages owing to its two-phase operation, it is not cost effective because it uses two inductors. In the single-inductor bipolar-output (SIBO) converter shown in top-right of Fig. 11.6.1, V op  and V on  are generated by using one inductor [3]. However, the SIBO converter operates with three phases, the build-up phase, V op  transferring phase, and V on  transferring phase, to regulate each output voltage. Therefore, the energy transferring time for each output is shorter than that of the structure in [2]. As a result, its output voltage has a large ripple. The efficiency of a SIBO converter with a flying capacitor increases by reducing the ripple of the inductor current (j L ) [4]; however, the energy transferring time for each output is still short. Although each output can be separately controlled to optimize the output voltage ripple [5], the operation is still based on the three phases.","source":"ISSCC","title":"11.6 A 1.46mm2 Simultaneous Energy-Transferring Single-Inductor Bipolar-Output Converter with a Flying Capacitor for Highly Efficient AMOLED Display in 0.5m CMOS"}},{"docId":"3624","weight":0.5252076803946176,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"As the power demand of computing cores grows explosively, large conversion ratio, high efficiency and compact 12V-to-1V DC-DC converters become increasingly important.

However, it is still challenging to robustly control a DSD converter to achieve fast transient responses. Hysteretic control is widely used in the buck converters for its simple structure and fast responses. However, it may not be feasible to apply hysteretic control to a DSD converter as the on times of the two phases must have 180 phase shift and cannot be overlapped. PWM control with fast Type-III compensation [2] is another attractive option, but it suffers from an inherent delay up to half of a switching period when responds to a load transient, as will be explained later.

However, the 10 8.2s  is longer than 16 switching periods for a load step of only 1A and a complicated phase mirroring circuit is also needed.

Miniaturized DC-DC voltage regulators (VRs), which can provide a low-voltage regulated output from a wide input range and deliver a few Watts, are essential in these systems. Wide-input-range integrated VRs, however have difficulty to simultaneously achieve high frequency (HF) operation and high power efficiency. Previous hard-switching (HS) high-input-voltage (HV) buck regulators can only operate at a low frequency of 100s of kHz in order to limit the dominant switching power loss PSW, that occurs at the converter switching node [1,2]. Low-frequency operation however results in using bulky inductors of 100s of H, significantly increasing the bill-of-material cost and the converter volume. Three-level converters (TLCs) are effective to reduce the required inductance by doubling the frequency at the switching node and allow using lower-voltage-rating power transistors in HV conditions. However, the concern of large PSW in HV conditions would still limit the HS TLC converter to operate in the MHz range. Moreover, the TLC needs the voltage across its flying capacitor to be balanced at half the input voltage; otherwise power transistors could be damaged during operation. In HF HV conditions, the capability of high-speed flying-capacitor self-balancing is even more crucial, but it is not addressed in prior 3-level DC-DC regulators [3,4].

The USB PD 3.1 extends the delivering voltage up to 48V, which requires a buck-boost converter with extreme conversion ratio  (CR= V_OUT\/V_IN)  range from 0.1,10, high-voltage (HW) stress switches, and fast transient response. Into the bargain, the USB Type-C interface with USB PD specification allows power delivery through a single port, which brings about the necessity for bi-directional power converter. To fulfill this task, one of the most common proposals is to implement two power converters for each direction, but this method will be costly to accomplish and will complicate the designs for controllers. Although the Three-level Buck-Boost converter (TLBB) in [1] can provide buck-boost conversion when  V_2 > 2V_1  (top left of Figure 11.7.1), node  V_x  will be 2 times  V_1 , which leads to inductor charging in both   1, 2 , and fails to transfer power from  V_2  to  V_1 . To transfer power from  V_2  to  V_1  by using the double step-down converter (DSD) [2],  V_1  needs to be 4 times larger than  V_2  due to the limit of CR. In prior DC-DC converters, it is hard to achieve both wide-range CR and bi-directional power conversion. Thus, this paper proposes a symmetric hybrid buck-boost converter (SHBB), which contains two adjustable voltage switched-capacitor (AVSC) cells to satisfy the specifications mentioned above, as well as bi-directional power transmission. Conventional buck-boost (CBB) converter can reach full-range CR, but it encounters low CR=0.1 in the case of 48-to-5V conversion, leading to difficulty in driver and controller designs. The bottom-left of Figure 11.7.1 shows the CR range comparison chart with state-of-the-arts. The DSD converter [2] can provide extreme CR (24V to 1 V) with relatively wider duty cycles, but its maximum CR is limited to 0.25, which is not qualified for USB PD 3.1.

As a reference-frequency generation block for clock management of the overall system, the relaxation oscillator has been widely adopted since it can provide a controllable and well-defined untrimmed frequency with low-cost circuits. In the past decade, the major goal in the design of the relaxation oscillators has been the improvement of phase-noise figure-of-merit (FOM) closer to the fundamental limit of 169dBc\/Hz [1]. There have been feedback approaches to internally generate reference voltages for comparison, hence compensating the comparator circuit delay [2-4]. Since the delay compensation relies on the feedback operation, power consumption by analog circuits to meet the required bandwidth of the feedback loop eventually limits FOM. Recently, a swing-boosted differential scheme was proposed to reduce the effect of comparator noise by boosting the signal slope at the comparator input, demonstrating an FOM of over 160dBc\/Hz [5]. However, the boosted voltage swing can increase stress on the input transistors of the comparator. In addition, a high-speed comparator is also needed to reduce the effect of the circuit delay on the output frequency. While most of previous works achieved good FOMs with MHz oscillators, implementation of low-frequency relaxation oscillators presents additional challenges since it requires excessive area for RC and power consumption by analog circuits with leakage not scaled down along with the output frequency.","source":"ISSCC","title":"5.5 A quadrature relaxation oscillator with a process-induced frequency-error compensation loop"}},{"docId":"2276","weight":0.042105158887168634,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Most systems require a voltage reference independent of variation of power supply, process, or temperature, and a bandgap voltage reference (BGR) often serves this purpose.

CMOS TIAs using the shunt-feedback (SF) topology (Fig. 12.2.1) have recently been shown to achieve adequate noise and bandwidth performance to facilitate 100Gb\/s receivers [14]. However, the SF- TIA suffers from debilitating tradeoffs between its noise and bandwidth, which make it fundamentally challenging to improve noise\/bandwidth performance beyond what has already been achieved. An alternative that has the potential to overcome the fundamental shortcomings of the single-ended (SE) SF-TIA is a differential TIA. Recognizing that the SE-SF-TIA only uses the photo-current flowing out of one terminal of the photodiode (PD), a differential TIA seeks to double the signal current by using the current coming out of the PD's other terminal (Fig. 12.2.1). As the PD current also flows in the complementary branch, the signal increases by 6dB at the cost of a 3dB increase in noise, resulting in a theoretical 3dB increase in SNR. However, achieving this 3dB SNR improvement in practice is difficult. To understand the reasons behind it, consider the conventional differential TIA as shown in Fig. 12.2.1. It employs capacitively coupled signal paths to bring the PD current to the TIAs. Resistors  R_B1(R_B2)  are used to reverse bias the PD and need to be chosen such that the corner frequency  (F_c)  of the high-pass filter formed by  R_B1C_C1(R_B2C_C2)  is low enough to pass the low-frequency components of the PAM-4 data. However, the maximum value of  R_B1(R_B2)  is limited by the tolerable voltage drop caused by the average PD current. For example, even a  300A  average current with  R_B1=R_B2=20k  would entail a 6V drop, which is prohibitively large in fine-line CMOS processes. In [5], the bias resistor was replaced by a regulator to alleviate the voltage headroom issue. But this approach is severely limited by the conflicting regulator output impedance  (R_OUT)  requirements: achieving a low  F_c  requires a large  R_OUT ; achieving good line\/load regulation and power supply rejection (PSR) mandates a low  R_OUT  Even if  R_OUT  is made as high as  20k  and  C_C1=C_C2=20pF , the high-pass corner would be nearly 400kHz, which is about an order of magnitude higher than what is needed for low baseline wander. Consequently, further increasing  C_C1\/C_C2  is the only viable option for lowering  F_c  However, the top\/bottom plate parasitic capacitors  C_PT\/C_PB  of the coupling capacitors severely degrade the TIA performance in two critical ways. First, they shunt the photocurrent, significantly reducing the signal current flowing into the TIA and lowering the effective transimpedance at high frequencies. Second, they add to the TIA input capacitance, reducing the TIA bandwidth and increasing its noise [6]. Because of these drawbacks, practical differential TIA performance is not superior to an SE-TIA.","source":"ISSCC","title":"A 7 pA\/Hz Asymmetric Differential TIA for 100Gb\/s PAM-4 links with 14dBm Optical Sensitivity in 16nm CMOS"}},{"docId":"3077","weight":0.034619071166302244,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Several 400G Ethernet standards (e.g. 400G-DR4\/FR4) have been developed to address the rapid increase in interconnect BW demand created by data-centric computing [1].

However, real-time imaging and navigation during high precision surgery necessitates the use of X-Ray fluoroscopy with most existing technologies to achieve precise localization. Intramedullary (IM) nailing is a common example of such high precision orthopedic surgery, which requires insertion of a nail into the medullary canal of a fractured bone followed by locking screws [1]. Proximal screw locking is performed using a mechanical guide, which is not possible for distal locking owing to the deformation (15mm) caused during insertion [2]. Freehand technique is typically used to localize distal holes, in which the surgical drill is aligned with the hole axis through fluoroscopic imaging. This process is time-consuming and exposes the patient and surgical team to high ionizing radiation. Various other methods, which reduce or eliminate irradiation during distal locking, are not widely used. This is attributed to their lack of compensation for significant deformation of the nail, added requirements such as computing systems, extra robotic arms, CT images, sophisticated hardware and software that require training for the surgeon and staff. This paper presents a navigation system for 3D localization using magnetic field gradients, which is inspired by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) but does not require the strong magnetic field used in MRI [3], and can replace fluoroscopy during IM nailing. The goal is to generate monotonically varying magnetic fields in the desired Field-of-View (FOV) such that each spatial point corresponds to a unique field value. The field is sensed by miniaturized devices in the FOV and communicated wirelessly to a receiver, which maps the field to spatial coordinates and displays the device location in real-time.

For this reason, although the main sensor is located outside the CPU, the sensing part is directly inserted into the logic in the form of remote probes, as shown in Fig. 13.6.1 [1]. However, the remote probe, which is composed of BJT or resistor, needs physical distance from the logic for improving gate-area uniformity and signal routing to the main sensor. In addition, the DTM period is inevitably long due to the time multiplexing and the requirement of setup time for analog blocks. Therefore, it is necessary to make the main sensor synthesizable and compact so that it can be inserted into the logic.

A resistive DAC (R-DAC) is widely used for its intrinsic low flicker noise. However, the design of a high PSRR and low flicker noise reference generator for R-DAC not only consumes extra power and area with an external RC filter [1] but also limits the peak SNDR performance [2]. In contrast, a current-steering DAC (I-DAC) has intrinsic PSRR. In addition, the use of a tri-level implementation with a dumped buffer reduces noise with a small input signal, which improves dynamic range (DR), but flicker noise from the bias circuit still limits the peak SNR of the ADC. Instead of using large-sized transistors or an off-chip RC filter for required low flicker noise, the sample-and-hold noise filter [3] is proposed for a low noise I-DAC by filtering the bias noise with an off-transistor-based filter, which requires periodic refreshing to compensate the bias voltage drift due to the gate-leakage current of the DAC cells. However, a trade-off between bias voltage drift and folded sampling noise of this technique limits its usage in more advanced technology because larger gate-leakage current is expected.

To achieve both a large bandwidth and high dynamic range with a 1 b    modulator, a high OSR and multi-GHz-rate sampling frequency are required. But there is a limit to the maximum sampling frequency of a    modulator, being a negative feedback system, in order to maintain loop stability and sufficiently low metastability, for a given technology node. To date, the maximum achievable bandwidth of a high-resolution 1 b    modulator is limited to a few tens of MHz. To achieve a bandwidth exceeding 100MHz with a single-loop    modulator, multi-bit quantization is essential [3][5]. When employing multi-bit quantization, the inherently linear property of a 1b DAC that consists of only a single unit element is lost, due to processing imperfections that cause mismatch errors between the multiple unit elements of a multi-bit DAC. The impact of static and dynamic mismatch errors can be effectively reduced with calibration, dynamic matching and analog\/digital compensation techniques.

Modern systems-on-chip (SoCs) require many such PLLs that cater to multi-core processors, memories, IO interfaces and power management. A ring-oscillator-based analog charge-pump PLL offers a flexible and power-efficient way to implement such clock multipliers. However, frequency compensation of analog PLLs requires a large loop filter capacitor that occupies significant area. The area penalty is further exacerbated in deep sub-micron CMOS processes due to increasing oscillator gain and gate leakage. For example, a 2GHz PLL in 65nm CMOS requires a 90pF capacitor (R=1k) to achieve 10MHz bandwidth and 70 phase margin. Assuming a capacitor density of 1fF\/m 2 , a 90pF capacitor occupies an area of 0.09mm 2 . Digital PLLs (DPLLs) offer an attractive means to eliminate the loop-filter capacitor [1, 2]. However, quantization error added by its loop components degrades the performance in multiple ways. First, it makes the DPLL loop inherently non-linear causing the steady state to be a bounded limit cycle, which manifests as deterministic jitter (DJ) at the PLL output. Second, it introduces conflicting noise bandwidth requirements, which makes it difficult to achieve low jitter in a power efficient manner. For instance, suppressing TDC quantization error by reducing PLL bandwidth increases the DCO phase noise contribution. As a result, DCO power must be increased to lower its noise contribution. This is especially problematic in ring-oscillator-based DPLLs. Finally, a high-resolution digital-to-analog converter (DAC) needed to interface the DLF output to the ring oscillator typically occupies large area and negates some of the area benefits of DPLLs [1, 2]. In view of these drawbacks, we present a PLL architecture that combines the advantages of analog (no quantization error) and digital PLLs (small area and scalability) by using a time-based integral path.

In this paper, we propose a filtering rnulti-stage noise-shaping (MASH)  ADC architecture that overcomes the abovementioned drawbacks. Passive delay compensating filters [4] are used to realize broadband and deep suppression of the input signal component at the internal filter nodes of the ADC. As a result, no interstage DACs are needed, which are commonly required to generate the quantization error replicas in a MASH  ADC, saving substantial power and greatly reducing the parasitic load of the high-speed critical nodes. Moreover, because of the absence of signal content at the internal filter nodes, the backend stages of the MASH architecture have relaxed linearity requirements and can be implemented with simple low-power Gm-C filters.

This is particularly troublesome when the input to the CTDSM consists of large out-of-band interferers; handling them without saturating the quantizer needs larger inband DR, leading to increased power dissipation. A solution to this problem is to use a filter upfront to attenuate interferers. Alternatively [1], the filter can be moved into the CTDSM loop. In [1], a 1 st -order RC filter was used to tame the STF peak of a cascade of integrators with feedforward summation (CIFF) DSM. Apart from the limited selectivity offered by a 1 st -order filter, an active feedback path was necessary to stabilize the loop. The CTDSM in our work obtains an STF with a sharper transition band and a lower cutoff frequency (normalized to the desired signal bandwidth) compared to [1], with the aim of more effectively attenuating close-in interferers. This is realized by embedding a 2 nd -order active filter into the CTDSM.

Besides, the poor CP current mismatch in a CP-PLL and the type-l loop feature of an XOR-PLL cause high reference spur levels. Alternatively, due to its inherently low in-band PN and relaxed-CP-design challenges, a sub-sampling PLL (SS-PLL) [4] can alleviate the above issues, and recently a 0.65V low-voltage (LV) SS-PLL was reported [5]. However, when further squeezing the SS-PLL V DD  down to sub-O.4V, several new issues arise, such as a limited tuning range of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), a limited voltage headroom of the VCO isolation buffer (ISO-BUF), and a large on-resistance of the sub-sampling phase detector (SSPD), resulting in the degradation of in-band PN and reference spur.","source":"ISSCC","title":"4.7 A O.4V-VDD 2.25-to-2.75GHz ULV-SS-PLL Achieving 236.6fsrms Jitter, 253.8dB Jitter-Power FoM, and 76.1dBc Reference Spur"}},{"docId":"2673","weight":0.05001819460436241,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"High-performance phase-locked loops (PLLs) and clock multipliers with low jitter\/phase noise are essential for numerous applications, such as digital microprocessors and SoCs, wireline\/optical links, data converters and wireless radios. Given the increasing cost per unit area of advanced CMOS nodes and the need for a multitude of PLLs in complex digital systems, there is a need to miniaturize the area of PLLs while not sacrificing jitter and phase noise performance. Ring oscillators are extremely compact when compared with their LC counterparts, but exhibit typically 15-to-20dB worse phase noise performance. A conventional analog charge-pump PLL that exploits a passive loop filter can be low-noise but requires a large loop-filter capacitor for frequency compensation, which dominates the area in a ring-oscillator PLL. An analog sub-sampling PLL [1] dramatically lowers in-band phase noise, but requires an even larger loop-filter capacitor to achieve comparable loop dynamics unless pulsing is employed [1,2]. Digital PLLs are extremely compact but are plagued by quantization-noise and deterministic-jitter issues. Active loop filters can substantially lower the area requirements as well, but are associated with severe linearity and (phase) noise penalties, which are further exacerbated as CMOS technology scales. A time-based proportional-integral-controlled (PI-controlled) active loop filter was presented in [3] that uses a current-controlled ring oscillator (CCRO) as an ideal integrator, addressing linearity and DC gain challenges, but the loop filter noise results in a jitter Figure-of-Merit (FOM) that is >10dB inferior to state-of-the-art ring-oscillator PLLs.","source":"ISSCC","title":"19.4 A 0.0049mm2 2.3GHz sub-sampling ring-oscillator PLL with time-based loop filter achieving 236.2dB jitter-FOM"}},{"docId":"2247","weight":0.04945616388666893,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"The trend for ADCs in wireless communication infrastructure is increased bandwidth with little or no relaxation in noise density or power consumption.

However, they typically have higher jitter and larger frequency drift due to high sensitivity to PVT variations. Several PLL architectures were proposed to reject the phase noise and reduce the frequency drift [1,2]. However, due to an architecture-level limitation, these phase-noise-rejection PLLs inevitably degrade the settling time. To suppress large phase noise (PN) and supply sensitivity, a Type-III PLL was proposed to provide a large low-frequency loop gain by using a 3 rd -order feedback loop [1]. However, high-order feedback loop degrades stability and requires low-frequency compensation zero, which needs a large loop filter and reduces the PN suppression bandwidth. To suppress the phase noise over a wide frequency offset, injection-locked (IL) PLL was proposed by injecting a clean reference into a noisy VCO [2]. But a sub-harmonic injection into a ring-VCO requires a pulse generator, which enhances harmonics but generates large reference spurs. Besides, a race condition between the injection-locking path and the PLL path weakens the locking strength and prolongs settling time by 5 times [2]. In order to reject the phase noise and to minimize supply sensitivity and frequency drift of ring-VCO-based PLLs without compromising other parameters, this paper proposes a 3 rd -order PLL employing a cascaded time-amplified clock-skew-sub-sampling DLL, measuring a 4.2s settling time, 1.05ps integrated jitter, and -113dBc\/Hz in-band phase noise with a 3.84mW power consumption at a 2.1GHz output frequency.","source":"ISSCC","title":"2.3 A 4.2s-settling-time 3rd-order 2.1GHz phase-noise-rejection PLL using a cascaded time-amplified clock-skew sub-sampling DLL"}},{"docId":"2397","weight":0.04886066204502296,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"M performance can be improved by using MASH or SMASH structures to obtain higher-order noise shaping [1].

While fully synthesizable PLLs have been reported, they suffer from high power consumption and large area. This arises because each stage of the ring needs to have a large number of parallel tristate buffers\/inverters in order to achieve the necessary frequency resolution. Moreover, custom-designed cells are required in prior synthesizable PLLs, introducing additional place-and-route (P   R) steps, leading to poor portability, integration, and scalability.

Another option is to generate a -140dBc THD sinusoid using an analog oscillator consisting of a BPF in a positive feedback loop with amplitude stabilization. In either case, the filter's distortion must be kept below -140dBc at a  10V_ppd  output swing, which is the typical full scale of ADCs operating with a 5V supply. Among active filters, the second-order Tow-Thomas active-RC topology with opamp-based integrators provides the lowest distortion levels [1]. Negative feedback with a high loop gain suppresses the components' distortion in the forward path, but increasing the loop gain does not completely suppress the distortion. This is because (a) distortion contributed by passive components in the feedback loop is not suppressed by the loop gain or (b) further increase in the global loop gain is infeasible because it compromises stability. The distortion-generating components must be identified, and their distortion contribution suppressed using local negative feedback or cancelled by subtracting the distortion component.

For example, the swing or number of quantization levels will be doubled if =1 is chosen. On the other hand, injecting the compensation current at the input of the last integrator requires an additional DAC and extra power to minimize excess phase shift [3]. The phase-feedback VCO-based integrating quantizer (VCOIQ) in [4] suggests a unique feature to compensate ELD in the phase domain. In this work, the VCO outputs are rotated directly in the digital domain to implement phase-domain ELDC (PD-ELDC) [5] without overloading any previous stages.
