However, Strong PUFs suffer from vulnerability to modeling attacks and a high bit-error rate (BER). The first Strong PUF, known as the arbiter PUF, has little tolerance against modeling attacks because of the linear summation of path-delay times in its response [1]. Several studies have been conducted to improve immunity by introducing non-linearity in the response-generation procedure [2] -[6]. Out of these, only look-up-table (LUT)-based solutions [2], [6] achieved a high machine-learning (ML) robustness against more than 0.1M training CRPs. However, the design in [2] requires 112K bits of entropy, and that in [6] uses many AES S-boxes, as well as entropy sources. The complex response procedures cause high native BER in Strong PUFs, although zero error is not essential because cryptography is not needed in the authentication procedure. CRP filtering [3], [5], [6], a popular countermeasure, not only reduces usable CRPs, but it also requires the server to perform additional tasks in both enrollment and authentication. Taking advantage of a LUT, one can apply SRAM-PUF stabilization techniques. Hot-carrier-injection (HCI) burn-in [7] does not reduce the number of usable bitcells. However, conventionally, it requires the inverse data to be written back before HCI burn-in.

Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) have drawn increasing attention as key security building blocks for authentication since each PUF circuit has unique challenge response pairs (CRPs). Such uniqueness is achieved by maximizing the effects of process variation using process-sensitive circuits, i.e. PUF cells. Recently reported PUF cell types include cells based on a two-transistor amplifier [1], NAND gate [2], ring oscillator [3], current mirror [4], back-to-back connected inverters [5], and inverter [6]. Regardless of the variation source, PUFs inevitably include CRPs that respond inconsistently when the process variation of the compared element in the CRP is small compared to noise.

Over time, the implementation of protection techniques against power analysis and EM attacks has progressively moved from design-specific (i.e., requiring redesign for their reuse [1][3]) to design-reusable frameworks [4][10], facilitating reuse with no modifications across designs, system security verification, and reducing the area\/power overhead through reuse of existing silicon infrastructure across secure design IPs on the same die. Accordingly, embedding protection into regulators has been extensively explored to degrade the attack SNR and increase the minimum traces to key disclosure (MTD) via current equalization [4], a switching regulator with randomized loop control [5], a digital LDO (DLDO) with noise injection [6], a DLDO with randomized thresholds and AES transformations [7], a DLDO based on an edge-chasing quantizer [8], current-domain signature attenuation [9] and an additional time-varying transfer function [10]. Such protections allow design reuse and some degree of power-security flexibility, but have common limitations in that: 1) they indiscriminately compensate the entire large-signal power rather than focusing on small-signal information-sensitive power contributions, preventing power overhead reductions, 2) the level of protection is set at design time, and cannot improve after chip fabrication (no learning), 3) they cannot adapt to mitigate newly discovered side-channel vulnerabilities and attacks.

Digital LDOs (DLDOs) are increasingly adopted in recent years thanks to voltage and process scalability. However, achieving a fast response to a load change requires a conventional synchronous DLDO to either increase its sampling frequency with a large power overhead, or include a large output capacitor (COUT) with increased chip area and cost. Various control schemes have been proposed to mitigate these drawbacks. In synchronous designs, attempts have been made to employ more complex control algorithms to achieve faster response [1], and to replace the PMOS switch array with switched capacitors for reduced dynamic energy consumption [2]. On the other hand, asynchronous DLDOs with event-driven [3] and beat-frequency VCO-based structures [4] show promise across the key performance, power and area metrics. Recently, voltage regulators are also found to be useful in enhancing the resistance of cryptographic engines and processors against power and EM side-channel attacks (SCAs) [5]-[7], which are physical attacks representing a severe threat to mobile and embedded devices. Employing regulators for SCA defense is promising because they are already used in most systems and require no modifications to existing computing architectures and algorithms like other circuit-level defenses [8]-[9].

SNR at low-light conditions, which is a key performance metric, is determined by the sensitivity and crosstalk in pixels. To improve sensitivity, pixel technology has migrated from frontside illumination (FSI) to backside illumiation (BSI) as pixel size shrinks down. In BSI technology, it is very difficult to further increase the sensitivity in a pixel of near-1.0m size because there are no structural obstacles for incident light from micro-lens to photodiode. Therefore the only way to improve low-light SNR is to reduce crosstalk, which makes the non-diagonal elements of the color-correction matrix (CCM) close to zero and thus reduces color noise [3]. The best way to improve crosstalk is to introduce a complete physical isolation between neighboring pixels, e.g., using deep-trench isolation (DTI). So far, a few attempts using DTI have been made to suppress silicon crosstalk. A backside DTI in as small as 1.12m-pixel, which is formed in the BSI process, is reported in [4], but it is just an intermediate step in the DTI-related technology because it cannot completely prevent silicon crosstalk, especially for long wavelengths of light. On the other hand, front-side DTIs for FSI pixels [5] and BSI pixels [6] are reported. In [5], however, DTI is present not only along the periphery of each pixel, but also invades into the pixel so that it is inefficient in terms of gathering incident light and providing sufficient amount of photodiode area. In [6], the pixel size is as large as 2.0m and it is hard to scale down with this technology for near 1.0m pitch because DTI width imposes a critical limit on the sufficient amount of photodiode area for full-well capacity. Thus, a new technological advance is necessary to realize the ideal front DTI in a small size pixel near 1.0m.","title":"7.1 A 1\/4-inch 8Mpixel CMOS image sensor with 3D backside-illuminated 1.12m pixel with front-side deep-trench isolation and vertical transfer gate"}},{"docId":"61","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Despite versatility and low power consumption, direct-conversion transmitters suffer from a fundamental drawback: the local oscillator disturbance by the power amplifier, through unwanted electromagnetic or capacitive coupling [1,2].

To alleviate this, time-consuming and often unpredictable optimization of the floor plan, package, and PCB is required to maximize the isolation between the PA and VCO. Ultimately, this issue may prohibit the use of this architecture for many applications, leading to higher power consumption. Moreover, in many modern radios it is common to have more than one VCO on-chip (Fig. 21.8.1) to support various features such as FDD, carrier aggregation, or coexistence, further exacerbating the problem through multiple-VCO cross-coupling.

However, current active matrix OLED (AMOLED) displays on foil do not validate this power-efficient advantage, as too much power is lost in the AM backplane. AMOLED displays use the analog voltage on the gate of a drive transistor (e.g. M1 in Fig. 30.2.1) to control the pixel current and hence the pixel brightness. Accurate and uniform pixel currents can only be obtained when transistor M1 is driven is saturation. In highresolution technologies on foil, transistor parameters W, L and the mobility  are limited by technology, imposing a minimal V GS -V T  to obtain sufficient current, i.e. V GS -V T  > 4V for a-IGZO on foil [1]. Subsequently, to obtain saturation, V DS  > 4V, which translates in a static backplane power loss surpassing the OLED power consumption (see red stars in Fig 30.2.1). However, when the OLED pixel impedance around a specific reference current can be matched along a display column line, the accurate pixel current control can be imposed by current DACs implemented in external silicon display column drivers. In this work, we operate M1 as a switch and pixel intensity variations are obtained using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) of a predefined pixel current, i.e. 2A\/pixel [8080m 2 ] (which corresponds in our OLED technology to a light output of 2000Cd\/m 2 ). When, in a future implementation the external DACs are calibrated at 0.2A\/pixel, the full brightness would correspond to the typical display brightness of a portable PC, i.e. 200Cd\/m 2 . This concept enables us to reduce the display power voltage at full brightness from 8.2V in a classical AMOLED display on foil configuration to 5V (measured) and for future implementations even down to 4V (see Fig. 30.2.1). As the OLED current load remains equal, a corresponding static power reduction of the display (and increased battery lifetime) is obtained. Digital driving methods of AMOLED displays have been shown before. However,  techniques [2] still integrate charge packets on the gate of M1 and hence do not solve the power issue on foil. Other PWM techniques [3] activate only a single active line in the linedriver yielding difficulties to obtain color depths above 6 bits. When multiple independent linedrivers are implemented and their output is multiplexed to alternately drive a single select line, a higher color depth can be obtained [4]. This leads however to a bulky linedriver, which is hard to get within an e.g. 80m pitch.

Paillier homomorphic encryption (PHE) [6] is one of the critical privacy computing techniques that enables the ciphertext to enjoy equivalent utility as the plaintext. In the PHE scheme shown on the upper left of Fig. 15.4.1, the client encrypts its plaintext into ciphertext and then sends it to the server, which performs the homomorphic evaluation and returns the encrypted results to the client. However, this process avoids the delivery of plaintext at the cost of several computing burdens, and we list three dominant challenges in the rest of Fig. 15.4.1. First, the ciphertext domain calculation needs expensive large integer modular arithmetic operations (e.g., modular multiplication (ModMul), modular inversion (Modlnv), and modular exponentiation (ModExp)) with several orders of magnitude higher energy and latency. Second, the client performs encryption and decryption featuring independent vector operations, while the server is expected to perform evaluations with multiply-and-accumulation (MAC) operations.

Instead of using multiple LC oscillators that are carefully designed to cover a wide frequency range [2,3], a ring-oscillator-based fractional-N PLL is used as a digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) to achieve both wide range and low noise, and to decouple the tradeoff between jitter transfer (JTRAN) bandwidth and ring-oscillator-noise suppression.","title":"8.7 A 4-to-10.5Gb\/s 2.2mW\/Gb\/s continuous-rate digital CDR with automatic frequency acquisition in 65nm CMOS"}},{"docId":"2","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"The four papers presented in this session highlight developments in clock generation and distribution.

Even in digital PLLs, which rely on a digital loop filter, the bandwidth still depends on the gains of two mixed-signal building blocks, namely the time\/digital converter (TDC) and the digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO), that have conversion characteristics that are not well-controlled. The situation is even more cumbersome employing a singlebit TDC, often referred to as bang-bang phase detector (BBPD), where the linearized gain is inversely proportional to the input jitter [1]. An accurate and repeatable value of the PLL bandwidth, and in the general of the frequency response, is essential to meet several specifications, such as stability margin, settling time, jitter and spur level. When the PLL is operated as a direct frequency modulator with pre-emphasis of the modulation signal, the accuracy requirement of the frequency response is even more demanding [2].

This paper presents a digital PLL employing a digital background normalization of loop gain, which makes it independent of any analog variable (except for the reference frequency, which often is available from an accurate source).

Figure 13.5.1(a) shows a contention condition between PU and PG transistors of a 6T-SRAM bitcell for the write operation. During the write operation, the PU transistor impedes the ability of the PG transistor to pull the storage node (S) from V DD  to ground. The bitcell may suffer a write failure at the stronger PU with weaker PG condition caused by the device variations. Two techniques have been proposed to improve the high density SRAM bitcell write V DDMIN : 1) negative bit-line voltage (NBL) to increase the strength of PG transistor and 2) lower cell V DD  (LCV) to weaken PU transistor strength [1-5]. Compared to the conventional techniques, this work develops a suppressed-coupling-signal negative bitline (SCS-NBL) scheme and a write-recovery-enhancement lower-cell-V DD  (WRE-LCV) scheme for write assist without the concern of reliability at higher V DD  operating region. A comparison of the effectiveness of the two design techniques is also performed. Figure 13.5.1(b) shows the layout view of the high-density 6T-SRAM bit-cell with 0.07m 2  area in a 16nm high-k metal-gate FinFET technology. To minimize area, we set the geometric ratio of PU, PG, and PD transistors all equal to one. With the two developed write-assist circuits, the overall V DDMIN  improvement can be over 300mV in a 128Mb SRAM test-chip.","title":"13.5 A 16nm 128Mb SRAM in high- metal-gate FinFET technology with write-assist circuitry for low-VMIN applications"}},{"docId":"24","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Energy-efficient networks-on-chip (NoCs) are key enablers for exa-scale computation by shifting power budget from communication toward computation. As core counts scale into the 100s, on-chip interconnect fabrics must support increasing heterogeneity and voltage\/clock domains. Synchronous NoCs require either a single clock distributed globally or clock-crossing data FIFOs between clock domains [1]. A global clock requires costly full-chip margining and significant power and area for clock distribution, while synchronizing data FIFOs add power, performance, and area overhead per clock crossing. Source-synchronous NoCs mitigate these penalties by forwarding a local clock along with each packet, but still suffer from high data storage power due to packet switching. Circuit switching removes intra-route data storage, but suffers from low network utilization due to serialized channel setup and data transfer [2].

Ideally, the TR should be in excess of one octave, since this allows the easy synthesis of all frequencies below those directly generated by the VCOs via repeated frequency divisions by 2. At the same time, the oscillation spectrum should be affected as little as possible by spurious (common-mode) magnetic fields impinging on the inductor coil in the VCO tank. This is a crucial requirement in modern radios, where there are more PLLs active at the same time, and particularly when (non-contiguous) carrier aggregation is implemented, since in this case the signal bands may be very close to each other. If an individual PLL is used for each band, the VCOs may oscillate very close to each other, or at frequencies that are harmonically related to each other, posing a very serious issue of mutual pulling through the respective magnetic field.

SNR at low-light conditions, which is a key performance metric, is determined by the sensitivity and crosstalk in pixels. To improve sensitivity, pixel technology has migrated from frontside illumination (FSI) to backside illumiation (BSI) as pixel size shrinks down. In BSI technology, it is very difficult to further increase the sensitivity in a pixel of near-1.0m size because there are no structural obstacles for incident light from micro-lens to photodiode. Therefore the only way to improve low-light SNR is to reduce crosstalk, which makes the non-diagonal elements of the color-correction matrix (CCM) close to zero and thus reduces color noise [3]. The best way to improve crosstalk is to introduce a complete physical isolation between neighboring pixels, e.g., using deep-trench isolation (DTI). So far, a few attempts using DTI have been made to suppress silicon crosstalk. A backside DTI in as small as 1.12m-pixel, which is formed in the BSI process, is reported in [4], but it is just an intermediate step in the DTI-related technology because it cannot completely prevent silicon crosstalk, especially for long wavelengths of light. On the other hand, front-side DTIs for FSI pixels [5] and BSI pixels [6] are reported. In [5], however, DTI is present not only along the periphery of each pixel, but also invades into the pixel so that it is inefficient in terms of gathering incident light and providing sufficient amount of photodiode area. In [6], the pixel size is as large as 2.0m and it is hard to scale down with this technology for near 1.0m pitch because DTI width imposes a critical limit on the sufficient amount of photodiode area for full-well capacity.

Reducing the over-sampling ratio can relax these requirements, but it results in more quantization levels and high-order noise shaping (NS). The feedback DAC often becomes a design challenge, as its distortion degrades ADC performance and can require linearization and higher supply voltage [2]-[4]. To avoid these issues, this work proposes a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)-based noise-shaping nonuniform sampling (NUS) ADC architecture, including an NUS modulator and a nonuniform digital signal processor (NU DSP). By leveraging the unique property of NUS [5], the spectral aliasing on the quantization error is independent of the actual average sampling rate, F s, avg . Thus, the quantization error can be shaped to a frequency much higher than F s, avg  and later filtered by NU DSP.

Instead of using large-sized transistors or an off-chip RC filter for required low flicker noise, the sample-and-hold noise filter [3] is proposed for a low noise I-DAC by filtering the bias noise with an off-transistor-based filter, which requires periodic refreshing to compensate the bias voltage drift due to the gate-leakage current of the DAC cells.

Second, it is harder to stabilize, especially considering PVT variations. For example, a slight change in the RC time constant can cause instability.

To support 1024-QAM in bandwidths up to 160MHz while maintaining sufficient EVM, the ADC has to achieve inband DR of 63-70dB over 80MHz baseband bandwidth. SAR ADCs are used extensively in Wi-Fi receivers due to their low power consumption and small area. But for DR > 60dB, quantization noise and comparator noise become the dominant noise sources. Noise shaping embedded within a SAR ADC has been utilized to suppress these noise sources with minimal overhead [1-2].

First, to alleviate the ISI, [1] presents a Real-Time Dynamic-Element-Matching (RT-DEM) algorithm to realize mismatch shaping for DAC cells, achieving 115dB SFDR without complex digital hardware as in [2]. However, the constraint of 1-LSB change with the RT-DEM limits dynamic range (DR) of the    modulator. Moreover, a high clock rate of 181 MHz causes a high power consumption. Second, with a large signal swing, the total harmonic distortion (THD) of current-to-voltage (I2V) amplifiers is frequently dominated by the HD3 in [1][5]. The potential cause of this HD3 is due to the velocity saturation effect (VSE) of poly resistors [6]. Lastly, for a large load capacitance, the damping-factor-control frequency compensation (DFCFC) is commonly applied in multi-stage amplifiers to enhance the stability [4], [5]. However, it degrades the amplifier inner-loop gain and causes severe COD. In [4], a compensation scheme inserts a gain stage inside the inner loop to boost the loop gain over the audio band (20Hz to 20kHz), suppressing the peak COD below 111 dBc. In this work, three techniques are presented to eliminate the aforementioned distortion sources: 1) a code-change-insensitive RT-DEM (CCI-RT-DEM) algorithm is introduced to dynamically select the new start index of rotated DAC cells for the next code, instead of the fixed index at the first one [1], thus allowing for more than 1-LSB change; 2) a poly-resistor linearization scheme is presented to suppress HD3 by mitigating the VSE of resistors; and 3) a 2nd-order DFCFC for multi-stage amplifiers is introduced that allows a high inner-loop gain to suppress the COD, thus enhancing the amplifier linearity even with a large C L .

In this paper, we propose a filtering rnulti-stage noise-shaping (MASH)  ADC architecture that overcomes the abovementioned drawbacks. Passive delay compensating filters [4] are used to realize broadband and deep suppression of the input signal component at the internal filter nodes of the ADC. As a result, no interstage DACs are needed, which are commonly required to generate the quantization error replicas in a MASH  ADC, saving substantial power and greatly reducing the parasitic load of the high-speed critical nodes. Moreover, because of the absence of signal content at the internal filter nodes, the backend stages of the MASH architecture have relaxed linearity requirements and can be implemented with simple low-power Gm-C filters.

While some demonstrate power efficiency reaching 180dB FoMs with medium-high ENOB (13), NS-SARs targeting >13-ENOB needs have yet to attain this leading efficiency. It calls for further efforts in two key aspects when pushing for higher ENOB. The first is to realize high-order (3) NS without significant overhead, so it can use a low OSR and avoid excess digital power. Recent work reports a 4 th -order NS-SAR by cascading two 2 nd -order EF structures, showing better simplicity over classic single-loop designs [3]. However, the use of static amps keeps power high. Also, due to the fact that its residue voltages (V RES ) contain the DC offsets from the comparator\/amp, the amp gain needs to be mild, which penalizes the thermal noise. The second need is to minimize the total kT\/C noise. kT\/C noise is largely unshaped and thus requires large capacitance, especially in the CDAC, to be reduced when high OSR is not desired. This makes the DAC area\/power hungry and hard to drive. In the context of standard SAR, ref [4] realizes a kT\/C noise cancelling scheme. Nonetheless, it cannot be directly applied to an NS-SAR.

The first is to implement high-order optimized NS with simple and low-power hardware that maximally preserves the efficient nature of the SAR.

The second concern is the growing kT\/C noise contribution under low OSR and the related large stress on the input driver. To alleviate this issue, ref [3] presents an NS-SAR with a loop-embedded input buffer that decouples the input capacitance from the kT\/C noise constraint; but it suffers from a large noise penalty introduced by the buffer and the separated CDAC.

Hence, their suppression of the comparator noise is limited. In addition, every capacitor switching introduces extra kT\/C noise. To reduce noise, a passive gain of 2 is realized in [2].

Classic DEM is unsuitable for SARs with a high-resolution DAC due to excessive hardware cost. To reduce circuit complexity, Ref.

When employing multi-bit quantization, the inherently linear property of a 1b DAC that consists of only a single unit element is lost, due to processing imperfections that cause mismatch errors between the multiple unit elements of a multi-bit DAC.

Power-hungry techniques, such as a Vernier delay line (VDL) and a time amplifier (TA) [1,2], have been proposed to improve time resolution. Recently, a digital-to-time converter (DTC) has been employed to enable power reductions of the VDL and TA-based TDCs by minimizing the number of VDLs and TAs [3,4]. However, the nonlinearity of the DTC remains a problem, since it is much larger than the time resolution of the TDCs and becomes a significant source of fractional spur in the ADPLL. In [3], the effect of the nonlinearity is decreased by utilizing a dithering technique at the expense of a long calibration time (> 100ms). The DTC requires inherently more calibration effort for full-scale-delay detection and normalization, since the difference between the full-scale delay and the DCO period also increases the fractional spur significantly. On the other hand, time-to-amplitude-conversion-based TDCs may be another candidate for a high-resolution low-power TDC [5].

This asks for more signal processing, and therefore, a move to more expensive deep-submicron technologies. This puts pressure on the area that can be spent on the increasing number of audio interfaces to enable competitive application costs. In this paper an automotive-grade, 4-channel  ADC is presented that has a large feature set, and is very competitive in performance, area, power and external component count. It supports 44.1\/48\/96\/192kHz audio, in rail-to-rail, single-ended, pseudo differential (floating source) and differential configurations. The ADC can be reconfigured as a rail-to-rail low-impedance DAC line output, to directly drive the speaker drivers in the car (the paper will focus on the ADC, as the DAC is included in the ADC performance). A high-impedance ADC input is required to avoid common-mode currents entering the chip in (pseudo) differential mode, and for direct interfacing with microphones. For a  ADC, the combination of a high-impedance input combined with low 1\/f noise comsuming low area is very challenging. Choppers can be used to break the area-performance trade-off, but chopping a rail-to-rail  ADC input gives rise to non-linearity and high frequency quantization noise folding. A power-efficient solution is presented in [2], in which noise folding is tackled by using an FIR filter in the  ADC feedback loop. The FIR filter rejects the quantization noise at the fold frequencies, avoiding fold back. However, the FIR notches provide no feedback at the notch frequencies, and the  ADC is open-loop at those frequencies. This causes overload when an input signal is applied at, or close to the notch frequencies. Furthermore, [2] lacks a high-impedance input and is large in area. Reference [3] sets the state-of-the-art for audio converters, making a very good area-performance trade-off, by using a SAR- hybrid ADC architecture, inverter-based integrators, and correlated double sampling to get rid of 1\/f noise.

During the write operation, the PU transistor impedes the ability of the PG transistor to pull the storage node (S) from V DD  to ground. The bitcell may suffer a write failure at the stronger PU with weaker PG condition caused by the device variations. Two techniques have been proposed to improve the high density SRAM bitcell write V DDMIN : 1) negative bit-line voltage (NBL) to increase the strength of PG transistor and 2) lower cell V DD  (LCV) to weaken PU transistor strength [1-5]. Compared to the conventional techniques, this work develops a suppressed-coupling-signal negative bitline (SCS-NBL) scheme and a write-recovery-enhancement lower-cell-V DD  (WRE-LCV) scheme for write assist without the concern of reliability at higher V DD  operating region. A comparison of the effectiveness of the two design techniques is also performed. Figure 13.5.1(b) shows the layout view of the high-density 6T-SRAM bit-cell with 0.07m 2  area in a 16nm high-k metal-gate FinFET technology.

As core counts scale into the 100s, on-chip interconnect fabrics must support increasing heterogeneity and voltage\/clock domains. Synchronous NoCs require either a single clock distributed globally or clock-crossing data FIFOs between clock domains [1]. A global clock requires costly full-chip margining and significant power and area for clock distribution, while synchronizing data FIFOs add power, performance, and area overhead per clock crossing. Source-synchronous NoCs mitigate these penalties by forwarding a local clock along with each packet, but still suffer from high data storage power due to packet switching.

While the OTA can be turned off to save power, it requires considerable time for the bias circuit and CMFB loop to settle when waking up, leading to wasted power and reduced peak operation frequency. Using an open-loop dynamic amplifier can make power scale linearly with frequency, but its gain varies with PVT and often requires background calibration, which converges slowly and is incompatible with event-driven applications.

Moreover, reduced voltage dynamic range in deep submicron nodes presents challenges for the design of high-performance amplifiers and fine quantizers in voltage domain. Therefore, implementing the fine quantizer in time domain becomes attractive due to its better noise tolerance and lower power consumption.

The requirement of the low-complexity thermometric DAC limits the maximum number of bits that can be used to fulfill the SQNR specification. In this work, rotating splitters (RSPT) and a segmented DAC are used to increase the VCOIQ resolution to 7b. This arrangement decouples VCOIQ optimization from DAC design constraints and fully exploits the advantage of time-domain quantization. By leveraging the techniques mentioned above, this CTDSM achieves 125MHz BW while operating at 2.15GHz.

Unfortunately, most previous works are based on incoherent direct detection (Fig. 25.5.1), which causes low sensitivity due to the output droping quickly with input power (VRF2), and, as a result, need exceedingly high power sources for illumination. This problem can be alleviated by utilizing coherent heterodyne detection scheme (Fig. 25.5.1), in which the terahertz input (RF) mixes with a local oscillation (LO) signal and generates an output with the amplitude proportional to VRFVLO. As the LO power is normally significantly higher than RF, the sensitivity is much enhanced. Moreover, as the output also carries the RF phase information (RF), digital beamforming is achievable. For a better comparison, an NPN transistor is configured both as a direct detector (input power injected from the emitter) and a heterodyne detector (-20dBm LO power pumped into the base). The simulated output current with different input power is shown in Fig. 25.5.1, in which we observe a sensitivity enhancement of more than 40dB.

In practice, pulse-based imaging supports fast data acquisition, but requires receiver (RX) with real-time wideband sampling (>50GHz). Such instantaneous broadband imaging modality inevitably exhibits severely degraded sensitivity (due to integrated noise) and requires high-end signal sampling, both of which make it very challenging to achieve a low-cost SoC solution.

Quality control, medical imaging and the detection of concealed objects are among the possible applications that can benefit from these properties. In the move towards affordable, compact, and low-power THz imaging solutions, developing highly sensitive detector arrays in CMOS technologies plays an essential role. Advancing from single-pixel chips to full arrays increases the imaging speed, as the time needed for precise and stable mechanical movement of an object or imager is typically orders of magnitude higher than the time needed for the pixel readout, especially as the detectors become more sensitive. The time gained can also be exchanged for more averaging time, which leads to higher image quality. Implementing the array in CMOS allows integration of digital control circuitry and image processing on the same die as the detectors. Detector arrays in CMOS operating above 350GHz typically use diode-connected or resistive mixing nMOS detectors with limited sensitivity [1][4]. These array types have not been able to achieve a noise-equivalent power (NEP) lower than  35pW\/Hz .

A coherent array of coupled sources could improve the radiated power but requires mechanical and slow scanning of the object [1]. Phased array systems could use beam steering to scan the object at a higher speed, but in both coherent-array and phased-array systems, large array sizes with high power consumption are needed to generate a highly directive and narrow beam for high image resolution [2-4]. Although Si lens can be used to increase directivity in a phased array, the steering capability is significantly diminished [5]. Therefore, arrays of non-coherent sources are used with Si lens to illuminate different parts of the object with each source with high directivity [6]. The firing angle of each source is determined by the ratio of its displacement (Ldis) from the lens center to the lens radius (Rlens), as shown in Fig. 23.2.1 [1]. However, this type of source can only illuminate the object in discrete steps determined by beam spacing, which in turn is limited by the inevitable distance between adjacent sources on the chip. Being constrained to independent single pixels for illumination leads to loss of resolution and blind spots between the neighboring beams (Fig. 23.2.1). A larger lens can improve the resolution by reducing the beam spacing but at the cost of a smaller total scanning range.","title":"23.2 A 436-to-467GHz Lens-Integrated Reconfigurable Radiating Source with Continuous 2D Steering and Multi-Beam Operations in 65nm CMOS"}},{"docId":"611","weight":0.6899045121649295,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Circular-polarized (CP) radiation is found to be a viable choice for imaging\/sensing applications by offering faster scan time and robust source-detector alignment compared to linear radiation [1].

Due to limited output power of transistors at mm-wave, power combining methods (e.g., on-chip or spatial power combining) are employed to achieve high radiated power from multiple oscillator elements [1-5].

Due to the limited  f_T\/f_max  of transistors, direct THz generation using a fundamental oscillator is not feasible; therefore, various approaches have been developed based on harmonic extraction and the frequency multiplication of a fundamental oscillator [2]. In these techniques, the nonlinearity of transistors is utilized to generate higher harmonics from a fundamental oscillator or frequency-multiplier cells; however, such systems have a poor efficiency and low radiated power due to device limitations. To compensate for the low generated power, a coherent array scheme is preferred to increase EI RP and radiated power. Adjusting the phase and locking the frequency of elements for coherent operation are important factors in array architectures, which can be performed through central LO distribution [3] and mutual coupling [4]. LO distribution can cause phase mismatch between elements and significantly increases the DC power consumption by adding more blocks. Mutual coupling through injection locking can maintain phase alignment. However, this type of coupling has low tuning range, which makes it challenging to synchronize elements over a broad frequency range. In this work, a technique for THz CW generation is presented, in which, instead of relying on transistor nonlinearity, a PIN diode is used in the reverse recovery mode for strong harmonic generation. A PIN diode, similar to a step recovery diode (SRD), benefits from a sharp reverse recovery and is highly nonlinear in the recovery mode, which enables efficient THz harmonic generation by upconverting the output of a mm-wave oscillator without requiring additional blocks and multipliers. The PIN-based array consists of 2x3 elements, where differential Colpitts oscillators are used as the core to push the PIN diodes into reverse recovery. Array elements are intercoupled using a collective coupling approach that enables wide tuning range and phase match between elements.

The 245GHz spectrometer in [2] presents 4mW radiated power, but only has a 14GHz bandwidth.

However, due to the limited power-generation capability of a single source above the device f max  [2], efficient spatial power combining from multiple coherent sources becomes necessary to generate mW level of power. To create this 2D array of distributed frequency and phase-locked sources, prior works have shown central LO-signal distribution with local harmonic upconversion [3]. However, this requires high power consumption in the LO distribution. In addition, phase-matching with PVT variations across the sources at the harmonic-radiating THz frequency can be quite challenging. A small  perturbation at the fundamental frequency translates to N at the radiated N th  harmonic, thus corrupting the array beam pattern. Another method to synchronize multiple distributed radiating sources (\/2 spaced at Nfo) is through a mutual coupling network with active\/passive elements in a coupled oscillator array [4], [5]. However, the locking range in these methods is typically narrow (f locking  f 0 \/20 to f 0 \/10) and PVT variations can easily cause desynchronization. In such a network, each cell is a self-sustaining oscillator, and the coupling network tries to establish injection signals to force synchronization between these individual free-running oscillators. In this paper, we used a 2D oscillating network with negative G m (-G m ) cells at each node that do not oscillate individually but only collectively, establishing a robust frequency and phase distribution network across the chip for high THz-power generation. By making this network as the lowest layer, we can now separate the locking mechanism and the power-generation sources. This avoids loading and sub-optimal operation of the power sources. The distributed oscillating network at the lowest layer operates at 69.3GHz, and multi-layer local harmonic generation produces a radiated power of -3dBm and +14dBm EIRP at 416GHz in a 44 array.","title":"29.9 A 44 Distributed Multi-Layer Oscillator Network for Harmonic Injection and THz Beamforming with 14dBm EIRP at 416GHz in a Lensless 65nm CMOS IC"}},{"docId":"320","weight":0.12174663302956305,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Electromagnetic waves in the millimeter- and sub-millimeter-wave frequency ranges are used in fast-scan rotational spectroscopy to detect gas molecules and measure their concentrations [1].

It employs a strong static magnetic field (1.5 to 10.5T for human imaging) to split the spin states of the  1 H nuclei in the body, and RF excitation to induce transitions and coherence among them. Gradient fields are superimposed to modulate the  1 H resonance frequency, which enables spatially distinguishable signals to be picked up by RF receive coils. A high-field MRI provides better sensitivity and resolution but requires better receivers (RX), as signal DR and  1 H resonance increase (128MHz for 3T, 300MHz for 7T). Overall sensitivity and imaging speed can be enhanced by closely surrounding the target anatomy with tens of RX coils (as in MIMO) [1], at the expense of as many shielded RF cables to carry the information out of the field. Progress in PCB size has allowed multi-channel RX to be placed inside the magnetic field (in-bore), reducing the RF cable length to less than 1m [2,3]. Ultimately, the RX should be placed directly on-coil to avoid bulky coaxial cables and improve patient comfort and safety by acquiring data in-bore and sending them digitally to the MRI scanner via an optical fiber link. The latter is cheap, flexible and insensitive to magnetic fields. The immediate vicinity of the coils and the patient is, however, a hostile as well as sensitive electromagnetic environment, which tolerates only the smallest of PCBs and virtually no magnetic material in its components.

Therefore, it is expected to achieve better performance with lower SRAM V DDMIN . However, the quantized sizing of the channel width and length has drawbacks for conventional 6T-SRAM bitcell scaling. To minimize the bitcell area of the high-density SRAM bitcell, the number of fins (setting the channel width, W) of the pull-up PMOS (PU), passgate NMOS (PG) and pull-down NMOS (PD) transistors must be selected as 1:1:1. Since PU, PG, and PD have the same channel length (L), the ratio in geometry between the PU transistor and the PG transistor is equal to one. With the process variations, the strength of PU transistor can be much stronger than the PG transistor. A stronger PU transistor increases read stability of the SRAM bitcell but it degrades the write margin significantly and results in worse write-V DDMIN  issue. Figure 13.5.1(a) shows a contention condition between PU and PG transistors of a 6T-SRAM bitcell for the write operation. During the write operation, the PU transistor impedes the ability of the PG transistor to pull the storage node (S) from V DD  to ground. The bitcell may suffer a write failure at the stronger PU with weaker PG condition caused by the device variations. Two techniques have been proposed to improve the high density SRAM bitcell write V DDMIN : 1) negative bit-line voltage (NBL) to increase the strength of PG transistor and 2) lower cell V DD  (LCV) to weaken PU transistor strength [1-5].

Ideally, the TR should be in excess of one octave, since this allows the easy synthesis of all frequencies below those directly generated by the VCOs via repeated frequency divisions by 2.

SNR at low-light conditions, which is a key performance metric, is determined by the sensitivity and crosstalk in pixels. To improve sensitivity, pixel technology has migrated from frontside illumination (FSI) to backside illumiation (BSI) as pixel size shrinks down. In BSI technology, it is very difficult to further increase the sensitivity in a pixel of near-1.0m size because there are no structural obstacles for incident light from micro-lens to photodiode. Therefore the only way to improve low-light SNR is to reduce crosstalk, which makes the non-diagonal elements of the color-correction matrix (CCM) close to zero and thus reduces color noise [3]. The best way to improve crosstalk is to introduce a complete physical isolation between neighboring pixels, e.g., using deep-trench isolation (DTI). So far, a few attempts using DTI have been made to suppress silicon crosstalk. A backside DTI in as small as 1.12m-pixel, which is formed in the BSI process, is reported in [4], but it is just an intermediate step in the DTI-related technology because it cannot completely prevent silicon crosstalk, especially for long wavelengths of light. On the other hand, front-side DTIs for FSI pixels [5] and BSI pixels [6] are reported. In [5], however, DTI is present not only along the periphery of each pixel, but also invades into the pixel so that it is inefficient in terms of gathering incident light and providing sufficient amount of photodiode area. In [6], the pixel size is as large as 2.0m and it is hard to scale down with this technology for near 1.0m pitch because DTI width imposes a critical limit on the sufficient amount of photodiode area for full-well capacity. Thus, a new technological advance is necessary to realize the ideal front DTI in a small size pixel near 1.0m.","title":"7.1 A 1\/4-inch 8Mpixel CMOS image sensor with 3D backside-illuminated 1.12m pixel with front-side deep-trench isolation and vertical transfer gate"}},{"docId":"61","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Despite versatility and low power consumption, direct-conversion transmitters suffer from a fundamental drawback: the local oscillator disturbance by the power amplifier, through unwanted electromagnetic or capacitive coupling [1,2].

However, current active matrix OLED (AMOLED) displays on foil do not validate this power-efficient advantage, as too much power is lost in the AM backplane. AMOLED displays use the analog voltage on the gate of a drive transistor (e.g. M1 in Fig. 30.2.1) to control the pixel current and hence the pixel brightness. Accurate and uniform pixel currents can only be obtained when transistor M1 is driven is saturation. In highresolution technologies on foil, transistor parameters W, L and the mobility  are limited by technology, imposing a minimal V GS -V T  to obtain sufficient current, i.e. V GS -V T  > 4V for a-IGZO on foil [1]. Subsequently, to obtain saturation, V DS  > 4V, which translates in a static backplane power loss surpassing the OLED power consumption (see red stars in Fig 30.2.1). However, when the OLED pixel impedance around a specific reference current can be matched along a display column line, the accurate pixel current control can be imposed by current DACs implemented in external silicon display column drivers. In this work, we operate M1 as a switch and pixel intensity variations are obtained using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) of a predefined pixel current, i.e. 2A\/pixel [8080m 2 ] (which corresponds in our OLED technology to a light output of 2000Cd\/m 2 ). When, in a future implementation the external DACs are calibrated at 0.2A\/pixel, the full brightness would correspond to the typical display brightness of a portable PC, i.e. 200Cd\/m 2 . This concept enables us to reduce the display power voltage at full brightness from 8.2V in a classical AMOLED display on foil configuration to 5V (measured) and for future implementations even down to 4V (see Fig. 30.2.1). As the OLED current load remains equal, a corresponding static power reduction of the display (and increased battery lifetime) is obtained. Digital driving methods of AMOLED displays have been shown before. However,  techniques [2] still integrate charge packets on the gate of M1 and hence do not solve the power issue on foil.

However, the published power efficiency, gain and output power are not sufficient for LTE applications [5], and its typical implementation requires an external supply modulator that is a high-speed power supply circuit [6]. Envelope elimination and restoration (EER) is an alternative supply modulation technique that can further improve the power efficiency over ET by replacing the linear PA with a switching PA driven by a phase signal [7]. However, to meet the specified low distortion, especially for LTE with a wide bandwidth baseband signal, an EER PA generally has difficulty achieving a wide bandwidth for the phase signal path, and requires a high-speed supply modulator, and highly accurate timing between envelope and phase signals. To overcome these problems, this paper introduces an envelope \/ phase generator based on a mixer and a timing aligner based on a delay-locked loop.

Recently, codeword-translation backscatter enables a low-power loT tag to be more compatible with existing infrastructures [3] (Fig. 31.5.1, top, fourth), while there are several shortcomings: 1) The tag still relies on wall power or battery, leading to bulky size or limited lifetime. 2) An additional decoder is required to compare the codeword-translation backscatter signal with incident BLE packets from the original access point (AP), so the backscatter signal cannot be directly demodulated by a commodity device. 3) The existing far-field backscatter chips realized a communication range less than 35m [3], which were not practical for most outdoor applications. 4) Each tag can only backscatter data unidirectionally towards the AP, while the tag can only detect the advertising (ADV) events instead of recovering the data coming from a commodity device [3], [4]. 5) Tag-to-tag communication has not been realized, so it's not able to construct a network for loT applications.","title":"A Passive Bidirectional BLETag Demonstrating Battery-Free Communication in Tablet\/Smartphone-to-Tag, Tag-to-Tablet\/Smartphone, and Tag-to-Tag Modes"}},{"docId":"96","weight":0.2957843642720526,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things has urged the development of ultra-low-power (ULP) radios at the lowest possible cost, while being universal for worldwide markets.

Two possible structures to implement a multichannel system are shown. A conventional multichannel architecture places the laser diode drivers (LDD) and VCSELs on the same side of the interposer. This paper describes a 125 two-dimensional optical I\/O array for 600 Gb\/s, utilizing 60 channels, each with an operating speed of 10Gb\/s. The physical limitation in the number of channels is relaxed by connecting the LDDs through vias to the VCSELs placed on the opposite side of the interposer. The arrangement of the RX, in relation to the two-dimensional photo detector (PD) and TIA array, is the same as the TX. Key elements of each channel are the LDD consuming 2.17 mW\/Gb\/s and the TIA that consumes 0.96 mW\/Gb\/s while achieving an input-referred noise of 0.95 A rms . The low power of the LDD and TIA improve the package reliability while the high sensitivity of the TIA enables the transmission via a long optical waveguide.","title":"8.2 A 125 two-dimensional optical I\/O array for 600Gb\/s chip-to-chip interconnect in 65nm CMOS"}},{"docId":"10","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"The recent revolution in handheld computing with high-speed cellular network made mobile processors have multi-cores and powerful 3D graphic engines that support FHD (19201080) or even higher resolutions.

The situation is even more cumbersome employing a singlebit TDC, often referred to as bang-bang phase detector (BBPD), where the linearized gain is inversely proportional to the input jitter [1].

To minimize the bitcell area of the high-density SRAM bitcell, the number of fins (setting the channel width, W) of the pull-up PMOS (PU), passgate NMOS (PG) and pull-down NMOS (PD) transistors must be selected as 1:1:1. Since PU, PG, and PD have the same channel length (L), the ratio in geometry between the PU transistor and the PG transistor is equal to one. With the process variations, the strength of PU transistor can be much stronger than the PG transistor. A stronger PU transistor increases read stability of the SRAM bitcell but it degrades the write margin significantly and results in worse write-V DDMIN  issue. Figure 13.5.1(a) shows a contention condition between PU and PG transistors of a 6T-SRAM bitcell for the write operation. During the write operation, the PU transistor impedes the ability of the PG transistor to pull the storage node (S) from V DD  to ground. The bitcell may suffer a write failure at the stronger PU with weaker PG condition caused by the device variations. Two techniques have been proposed to improve the high density SRAM bitcell write V DDMIN : 1) negative bit-line voltage (NBL) to increase the strength of PG transistor and 2) lower cell V DD  (LCV) to weaken PU transistor strength [1-5].

Ideally, the TR should be in excess of one octave, since this allows the easy synthesis of all frequencies below those directly generated by the VCOs via repeated frequency divisions by 2. At the same time, the oscillation spectrum should be affected as little as possible by spurious (common-mode) magnetic fields impinging on the inductor coil in the VCO tank. This is a crucial requirement in modern radios, where there are more PLLs active at the same time, and particularly when (non-contiguous) carrier aggregation is implemented, since in this case the signal bands may be very close to each other. If an individual PLL is used for each band, the VCOs may oscillate very close to each other, or at frequencies that are harmonically related to each other, posing a very serious issue of mutual pulling through the respective magnetic field. And even if a single VCO is used [2], or two (or more) VCOs that are not harmonically related [3], it is nevertheless a good practice to design the tank inductor as insensitive as possible to external magnetic fields, which abound in and close to the radio IC.","title":"21.6 A 2.4-to-5.3GHz dual-core CMOS VCO with concentric 8-shaped coils"}},{"docId":"56","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Since the invention of radio, superheterodyne has been the architecture of choice for receivers (RX).

Another drawback is that the use of multibit digital modulation is very difficult, if not impossible. An exception to this is the combination of quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) and frequency tripling. When a QPSK-modulated intermediate frequency (IF) signal undergoes frequency tripling, the resulting signal constellation remains that of QPSK with some symbol permutation. Such a tripler-last 240GHz QPSK TX was reported [8]. However, a 16-QAM constellation, for example, would suffer severe distortion by frequency tripling. If the 300GHz band is to be seriously considered for a platform for ultrahigh-speed wireless communication, QAM-capability will be a requisite.","title":"20.1 A 300GHz 40nm CMOS transmitter with 32-QAM 17.5Gb\/s\/ch capability over 6 channels"}},{"docId":"484","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Increasing mobile data demands are pushing cellular network capacity.

However, prior arts cannot realize low power and small area at the same time. As the SIF architecture needs RF notch filters to suppress image response, it requires multiple on-chip inductors resulting in large area.

Another effort on BLE transceivers is implementing antenna impedance-matching circuits on a chip to reduce BOM cost [1,2]. Previous on-chip matching circuits aimed at zero external components are limited to 50O antennas only. However, the antenna impedance is not always 50, such as a monopole antenna with poor ground design. Thus, tunability of the impedance matching is needed to adjust the impedance to 50.

In a typical M-phase passive mixer, shown in Fig. 3.6.1a, most out-of-band blockers are heavily attenuated by large shunt capacitors at the inputs of the baseband TIAs. Harmonic blockers are an exception and do not experience this attenuation since they are downconverted inside the TIA bandwidth, are amplified along with the wanted signal, and are only rejected by the subsequent harmonic-rejection circuitry.

Even in digital PLLs, which rely on a digital loop filter, the bandwidth still depends on the gains of two mixed-signal building blocks, namely the time\/digital converter (TDC) and the digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO), that have conversion characteristics that are not well-controlled. The situation is even more cumbersome employing a singlebit TDC, often referred to as bang-bang phase detector (BBPD), where the linearized gain is inversely proportional to the input jitter [1]. An accurate and repeatable value of the PLL bandwidth, and in the general of the frequency response, is essential to meet several specifications, such as stability margin, settling time, jitter and spur level. When the PLL is operated as a direct frequency modulator with pre-emphasis of the modulation signal, the accuracy requirement of the frequency response is even more demanding [2]. Previously disclosed methods to control PLL bandwidth require a modulation signal to be injected into the loop [2], compensate the gain variations of just a single block (e.g., VCO [3] or BBPD [4]), or operate in the foreground [5]. This paper presents a digital PLL employing a digital background normalization of loop gain, which makes it independent of any analog variable (except for the reference frequency, which often is available from an accurate source).

Therefore, it is expected to achieve better performance with lower SRAM V DDMIN . However, the quantized sizing of the channel width and length has drawbacks for conventional 6T-SRAM bitcell scaling. To minimize the bitcell area of the high-density SRAM bitcell, the number of fins (setting the channel width, W) of the pull-up PMOS (PU), passgate NMOS (PG) and pull-down NMOS (PD) transistors must be selected as 1:1:1. Since PU, PG, and PD have the same channel length (L), the ratio in geometry between the PU transistor and the PG transistor is equal to one. With the process variations, the strength of PU transistor can be much stronger than the PG transistor. A stronger PU transistor increases read stability of the SRAM bitcell but it degrades the write margin significantly and results in worse write-V DDMIN  issue. Figure 13.5.1(a) shows a contention condition between PU and PG transistors of a 6T-SRAM bitcell for the write operation. During the write operation, the PU transistor impedes the ability of the PG transistor to pull the storage node (S) from V DD  to ground. The bitcell may suffer a write failure at the stronger PU with weaker PG condition caused by the device variations. Two techniques have been proposed to improve the high density SRAM bitcell write V DDMIN : 1) negative bit-line voltage (NBL) to increase the strength of PG transistor and 2) lower cell V DD  (LCV) to weaken PU transistor strength [1-5].

An inverter-like architecture which uses both PMOS and NMOS results in the cancellation of AM-PM distortion which is particularly important in high-fidelity amplification of OFDM systems and high-order modulation schemes like 16- and 64-QAM, which are very sensitive to phase distortion. Furthermore, the complementary nature allows deep Class-AB operation, giving a high power efficiency at power back-off comparable to state-of-the-art 60GHz PA structures based on NMOS only.","title":"14.3 A Push-Pull mm-Wave power amplifier with <0.8 AM-PM distortion in 40nm CMOS"}},{"docId":"46","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"An FPGA employing c-axis aligned crystal In-Ga-Zn oxide (CAAC-IGZO) FET [1] based configuration memories (CMs) is known to need no reconfiguration thanks to nonvolatile CMs, shows high operation speed due to boosting effect of pass gates used in routing switches (RS) [2], and easily realizes fine-grained multi-context (FG-MC) architecture [2] because CMs which need very low power to keep the contents can be constructed with a small number of transistors.

Ideally, the TR should be in excess of one octave, since this allows the easy synthesis of all frequencies below those directly generated by the VCOs via repeated frequency divisions by 2. At the same time, the oscillation spectrum should be affected as little as possible by spurious (common-mode) magnetic fields impinging on the inductor coil in the VCO tank. This is a crucial requirement in modern radios, where there are more PLLs active at the same time, and particularly when (non-contiguous) carrier aggregation is implemented, since in this case the signal bands may be very close to each other. If an individual PLL is used for each band, the VCOs may oscillate very close to each other, or at frequencies that are harmonically related to each other, posing a very serious issue of mutual pulling through the respective magnetic field.

Therefore, the frequency difference between the transmitted and received signals can define the distance and speed of objects. There are two approaches of interfacing antenna for a FMCW radar, namely two-antenna (i.e. separated-antenna) and single-antenna (i.e. shared-antenna) methods.

An RF bandwidth of 13GHz yields an 11mm range resolution, and the high RF carrier permits greater velocity and MIMO-angular resolution. An external chirp signal at 16.1GHz is upconverted to 145GHz via a cascade of two frequency triplers in the RX and TX. For MIMO operation, a central chirp signal from a sub-sampling PLL integrated in 28nm CMOS [1] is distributed to multiple TRX chips on a PCB, eliminating mm-wave signal routing. The radar operates over a 0.15-to-10m range using fast sawtooth chirps of 5-to-50s duration. The beat frequency at IF fits between 400kHz and 15MHz. The on-chip TX leakage produces a strong beat near DC, suppressed via active highpass filtering. However, group delays of the PA and LNA can shift the beat into the RX passband.

In [2], 3 transmitters (TX) and 4 receivers (RX) are utilized to create a multi-mode radar transceiver, however its on-board antenna integration solution limits its size and cost for short-distance applications.

However, the best-reported range resolution cannot go below 1.5mm with a 100GHz bandwidth [1], which is not enough for many industrial applications like small-defect detection and surface screening. Moreover, most previous works [3-5] are based on conventional transceiver architectures that use separate antennas for TX and RX or use parallel multi-antenna designs to increase the frequency bandwidth [1]. These structures not only increase the chip size but also degrade the radar performance when they are placed at the focal point of a collimating lens. This degradation occurs due to the separated antenna phase centers, which are not well located at the collimating lens focal point, causing a multi-beam radiation pattern. To overcome these challenges, we have adopted an autodyne FMCW radar structure [6,7] with a phase processing method on the radar IF signal [7]. The autodyne is an oscillator that simultaneously carries out functions of generating the transmission and mixing the transmitted and reflected signals. There is no separate path for the RX signal in the autodyne, as the radiated and reflected signals exist at the same point of the autodyne circuit. Hence, it utilizes a combined antenna with a single-phase center for both transmitting and receiving parts. Besides, the phase processing method allows us to measure short ranges with an error no more than one-tenth of one-percent, which in terahertz frequencies provides micrometer resolutions [7]. Using these approaches, this paper demonstrates an autodyne FMCW radar with 66.7GHz bandwidth from 191GHz to 257.7GHz with a minimum range resolution of 54m.

Today, multi-chip radar cascading solutions use mm-wave LO frequencies (20GHz [1], [2], 40GHz [3]) along with on-chip frequency multipliers with modest multiplication factors (4 [1], [2], 2 [3]).

The idea of a secure directional wireless link between a TX\/RX pair is to preserve the signal information within a secure cone where the intended receiver is located while scrambling signals everywhere else to prevent eavesdropping. In a phased array, the same temporal digital information is fed to all the TX elements, transmitting the same information to all directions albeit at different power levels. This information can be recovered (especially at the side lobes) with a sensitive enough receiver. Spatial modulation with I, Q radiated out through separate antennas, and modulation of parasitic elements can distort the constellation in other directions [3], [4]. However, this one-to-one (bijective) mapping allows potential decoding by the eavesdropper, particularly using various signal processing and machine-learning-based classification techniques.

The commonly used bistatic configuration, however, leads to serious beam misalignment between TX and RX, when large-aperture lenses\/mirrors are used for longer range and higher spatial precision. As shown in [1], a 4mm physical separation between TRX antennas at 122GHz can cause 6 TRX beam misalignment, exceeding the 3dB beamwidth of the 29dBi-directivity beam. Monostatic radars are, therefore, preferred in those applications, when sufficient TRX isolation is achieved to avoid saturating the RX. Prior monostatic radars [2][6] adopt hybrid\/directional couplers for passive TRX duplexing, but at the cost of 3dB+3dB insertion loss inherent to couplers. In [3], such extra loss is mitigated through two sets of hybrid couplers and a quad-feed circularly polarized antenna. Note that in all full-duplex systems, antenna interface mismatch degrades the TRX isolation; in [3], the achieved 26dB isolation relies on excellent antenna matching enabled by backside radiation through a silicon lens. In comparison, frontside radiation allows for low-cost packaging and pairing with compact, large-aperture planar lens, but it causes much degraded antenna matching, hence is challenging for monostatic operation. In this paper, we present a 140GHz monostatic radar in CMOS, which not only circumvents the 6dB inherent insertion loss of couplers, but also facilitates the highly-desired frontside radiation through an adaptive self-interference cancellation (SIC), achieving 33.3dB of total TRX isolation.","title":"A 140GHz Transceiver with Integrated Antenna, Inherent-Low-Loss Duplexing and Adaptive Self-Interference Cancellation for FMCW Monostatic Radar"}},{"docId":"1241","weight":0.28327011327909307,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"The spectrum above 100GHz is expected to spawn a generation of ultra-high-speed wireless links and intelligent sensing and imaging applications.

This functionality is paramount for communications-on-the-move applications, wireless link discovery, and rapid beam alignment\/tracking at mm-wave and THz frequencies [2]-[9]. The current protocols for direction finding and beam alignment in 5G mm-wave systems are based on iterative algorithms that are often non-scalable, time-consuming, and computationally expensive, posing serious challenges for low-latency applications. Thus there is a need to process such direction-finding methods at the `edge nodes', to enable secure scalable networks with very low latencies [10]. In this article, we present a spectrum-to-space mapping principle, where localization information can be processed at the edge `sensor node' through the spectrum sensing. The conceptual idea is presented in Fig. 22.1.1, which shows an access point (transmitter\/receiver) that acts as a THz prism casting different spectral portions of a broadband THz signal across space.

Therefore, the use of self-steering spatial notch filters (SNFs) is necessary to aid the digital beamformers and reduce RX\/ADC power consumption while strong blockers exist. To address that, the sub-6GHz RXs in [1], [2] synthesize a baseband spatial notch impedance and translate it to RF by passive mixers.

To achieve excellent performance, phased arrays require lownoise and high-linearity front-ends [5]. Most importantly, arrays demand uniform performance from all elements for optimum receiving G\/T value and transmission effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) [6]. Figure 14.7.1 exemplifies it with an array whose antenna element has 3dBi uniform gain on one side and no radiation on the other side. When all elements in an 81 linear array with a \/2 space have identical characteristics, the array presents a 19dBi gain in the normal direction. Any temperature change in the array can be decomposed into an absolute temperature change superposed with a relative temperature variation. When the absolute temperature increases, the frontend gain decreases by as much as -0.1dB\/C [1]. When there is non-uniform solar radiation or heat generation inside the array, the relative temperature variation may present a gradient or a parabolic distribution. Taking a 641 array as an example, when there is a gain\/phase mismatch with an average value of 0.125dB\/1.25 between adjacent elements in a parabolic distribution locating at the center of the array, the formed beam presents a 1.4dBi main-lobe reduction in the normal direction and an 11.9dBi side-lobe degradation, shown in Fig. 14.7.1.

However, periodic calibration inevitably takes time overhead and prevents array systems from full-time operations.

To ensure sufficient link budget under mm-wave path losses, array-based systems are required. However, element coupling in practical antenna arrays varies each antenna load from its ideal  50  impedance (i.e., VSWR = 1). Power amplifiers (PAs) govern the overall transmitter (Tx) performance yet are the most susceptible blocks to VSWR variation, as they interface directly with antennas. The antenna VSWR alters the PA load, degrading the PA linearity, efficiency, output power, and reliability. Multiple proposed reconfigurable PAs maintain the PA performance under VSWR but require VSWR resilient built-in-self-test (BiST), particularly on-chip power and impedance sensors, to determine the PA operation\/reconfiguration. Previous work on power detectors is primarily based on voltage sensing, which only tracks the true RF power for a fixed and known real load. The works in [1] and [2] detect both load current and voltage to measure the real RF power over VSWR. However, both only properly operate for differential PAs, while most mm-wave front-end\/antenna interfaces require single-ended connections. Meanwhile, reported impedance detectors consist of either an equivalent passive series element or shunt element with large capacitive loading [3][5].

To minimize the bitcell area of the high-density SRAM bitcell, the number of fins (setting the channel width, W) of the pull-up PMOS (PU), passgate NMOS (PG) and pull-down NMOS (PD) transistors must be selected as 1:1:1. Since PU, PG, and PD have the same channel length (L), the ratio in geometry between the PU transistor and the PG transistor is equal to one. With the process variations, the strength of PU transistor can be much stronger than the PG transistor. A stronger PU transistor increases read stability of the SRAM bitcell but it degrades the write margin significantly and results in worse write-V DDMIN  issue. Figure 13.5.1(a) shows a contention condition between PU and PG transistors of a 6T-SRAM bitcell for the write operation. During the write operation, the PU transistor impedes the ability of the PG transistor to pull the storage node (S) from V DD  to ground. The bitcell may suffer a write failure at the stronger PU with weaker PG condition caused by the device variations. Two techniques have been proposed to improve the high density SRAM bitcell write V DDMIN : 1) negative bit-line voltage (NBL) to increase the strength of PG transistor and 2) lower cell V DD  (LCV) to weaken PU transistor strength [1-5]. Compared to the conventional techniques, this work develops a suppressed-coupling-signal negative bitline (SCS-NBL) scheme and a write-recovery-enhancement lower-cell-V DD  (WRE-LCV) scheme for write assist without the concern of reliability at higher V DD  operating region. A comparison of the effectiveness of the two design techniques is also performed.

A global clock requires costly full-chip margining and significant power and area for clock distribution, while synchronizing data FIFOs add power, performance, and area overhead per clock crossing.

This situation can be accompanied by other external factors, such as antenna blockage, that increase VSWR. To restore the PA performance under increasing VSWR conditions, one can use a tunable matching network (TMN) that is controlled by the observed VSWR.

The D-band frequency range (110 to 170GHz) offers ample spectrum and acceptable propagation characteristics for next generation, high-data-rate backhaul systems [1], [2]. A D-band transceiver (TRX) coupled with a 2D phased-array module can overcome the free-space path loss in a flat panel with added capabilities such as self-alignment and pole-vibration mitigation. Such an FDD system (proposed in Fig. 4.1.1(a)) can also be used in self-organizing networks if deployed in a PTMP configuration. Furthermore, if deployed in a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) setup it can achieve very-high-throughput wireless links reaching data-rates exceeding 100Gb\/s [1]. To demonstrate such a system two main components are required: First, a high-performance D-band TRX capable of high-order, wide-bandwidth modulation such as the one presented in [1]. Second, scalable TX\/RX phased-array front-end modules with 2D scanning capability. Recently published D-band phased-arrays [2][6] have reduced usability as they can only be scaled in one dimension. To overcome this limitation, a 2D-scalable array must be realized without compromising system performance. Hence, at D-band, this demands new interposer materials and compact TX\/RX phased-array chipsets. This is a difficult problem with current packaging technologies due to their limited available routing layers [2], [3]. Moreover, at D-band, the physical dimensions of the antennas and their spacing become comparable to the size of the phased-array chipsets or even smaller [2][6]. This work addresses and overcomes the above challenges as follows. First, a low-loss, fine-lithography interposer technology with multi-layer routing is utilized. It is based on a glass substrate with two redistribution layers (RDL) providing four metal layers. The glass substrate acts both as the flip-chip site and integration platform for RF distribution networks, waveguide interfaces, antennas, and digital\/power routing. The phased-array TX\/RX chips are designed to be directly attached to the antenna feed points, thereby minimizing interface losses. 0.7A (140GHz) antenna spacing was chosen in part for backhaul PTP applications with stringent grating lobe yet relaxed scanning requirements.

Although this topology eases the design, it faces chip area increase due to many separate matching networks for the PA\/LNA\/switch, as well as the switch loss that degrades the PA output power (Pout) and LNA noise figure (NF). On the other hand, though bi-directional mm-wave front-ends are gaining popularity, existing designs only show narrow bandwidth and very limited PA Pout and efficiency.","title":"A 26-to-39GHz Broadband Ultra-Compact High-Linearity Switchless Hybrid N\/PMOS Bi-Directional PA\/LNA Front-End for Multi-Band 5G Large-Scaled MIMO System"}},{"docId":"1328","weight":0.45773525594584447,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"As millimeter-wave (mm-wave) 5G technology adoption expands, it faces growing technical challenges.

There are three key design considerations in small satellite systems. First is the limitation of power consumption due to not only the limited energy from solar panels but also severe thermal management in space. Second is the requirement of beam steerability with large equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) to communicate from 500km to 2000km in low earth orbit (LEO). Active phased-array technology is a prominent satellite transmitter (TX) solution. When the element number increases by N times, single-power-amplifier (PA) output power and total power consumption can be reduced by N 2  times and N times, respectively, under the constant EIRP condition. Thus, reducing PA output power and increasing the number of elements are the most efficient design strategies for lowering power consumption. This is illustrated in the upper left graphs in Fig. 19.4.1. The third consideration is that the satellite TX needs to generate accurate single and dual circular polarization (CP) signals for several situations: single polarization for polarization-multiplexing under a multi-satellite environment; dual circular polarization for high data throughput downlink. Especially in both cases, the crosspolarization discrimination (XPD), which represents the accuracy of CP, is the essentially required performance to avoid conflict between two satellite communication systems and\/or interference between two signals in a single satellite communication system as the scenario is demonstrated in the upper right figure in Fig. 19.4.1.","title":"19.4 A Small-Satellite-Mounted 256-Element Ka-Band CMOS Phased-Array Transmitter Achieving 63.8dBm EIRP Under 26.6W Power Consumption Using Single\/Dual Circular Polarization Active Coupler"}},{"docId":"1455","weight":0.42210249704566927,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations have been demonstrated as a ground breaking technology for providing low-cost low-latency global internet access.

One possible solution is further minimizing satellite mass, such as cube satellites, by realizing an ultra-low-power Kaband phased-array transceiver. In this work, 1W power consumption is targeted for a 256-element Ka-band phased-array receiver, i.e. 4mW per element. In the conventional geostationary communication satellites, a parabolic antenna is utilized, and a transceiver module is placed inside a metallic cavity so it can tolerate cosmic radiation. On the other hand, LEO satellites need beam-steering functionality by using a phased-array antenna, and only a thin shield layer can be inserted between antennas and ICs for avoiding redundant mass and insertion loss. Thus, the radiation-hardening and low power consumption are key requirements for such cube satellite phased arrays. For RF building blocks in a phased array, the total ionizing dose (TID) is more critical than the single event effects (SEE).

In addition, since the small satellites cannot have the large-size antenna installed on the main body, a deployable membrane is attached to the main body for the large phased-array antenna.

Figure 14.7.1 exemplifies it with an array whose antenna element has 3dBi uniform gain on one side and no radiation on the other side. When all elements in an 81 linear array with a \/2 space have identical characteristics, the array presents a 19dBi gain in the normal direction. Any temperature change in the array can be decomposed into an absolute temperature change superposed with a relative temperature variation. When the absolute temperature increases, the frontend gain decreases by as much as -0.1dB\/C [1]. When there is non-uniform solar radiation or heat generation inside the array, the relative temperature variation may present a gradient or a parabolic distribution. Taking a 641 array as an example, when there is a gain\/phase mismatch with an average value of 0.125dB\/1.25 between adjacent elements in a parabolic distribution locating at the center of the array, the formed beam presents a 1.4dBi main-lobe reduction in the normal direction and an 11.9dBi side-lobe degradation, shown in Fig. 14.7.1.

However, element coupling in practical antenna arrays varies each antenna load from its ideal  50  impedance (i.e., VSWR = 1). Power amplifiers (PAs) govern the overall transmitter (Tx) performance yet are the most susceptible blocks to VSWR variation, as they interface directly with antennas. The antenna VSWR alters the PA load, degrading the PA linearity, efficiency, output power, and reliability. Multiple proposed reconfigurable PAs maintain the PA performance under VSWR but require VSWR resilient built-in-self-test (BiST), particularly on-chip power and impedance sensors, to determine the PA operation\/reconfiguration. Previous work on power detectors is primarily based on voltage sensing, which only tracks the true RF power for a fixed and known real load. The works in [1] and [2] detect both load current and voltage to measure the real RF power over VSWR. However, both only properly operate for differential PAs, while most mm-wave front-end\/antenna interfaces require single-ended connections.

To meet simultaneous requirements for high efficiency and reasonable linearity, PAs intended for use with complex modulation are often operated in Class-AB mode [1,2]. For small input amplitude in Class-AB, the device is turned-on and has an input capacitance (C gs ) of (2\/3)WLC ox . As the input amplitude becomes large, the device turns-off for part of the RF cycle, thus reducing its effective input capacitance. This input capacitance-modulation effect creates an input-amplitude-dependent phase shift in Class-AB mode resulting in an amplitude-modulation to phase-modulation (AM-PM) distortion [2]. Consequently, it degrades linearity metrics (e.g., error vector magnitude (EVM), adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR)) in complex-modulation systems.

However, compared with analog phased-array and hybrid systems, due to the absence of any rejection for spatial in-band blockers, the  RX\/ADC  dynamic range and linearity should be high enough to prevent array saturation. Therefore, the use of self-steering spatial notch filters (SNFs) is necessary to aid the digital beamformers and reduce RX\/ADC power consumption while strong blockers exist. To address that, the sub-6GHz RXs in [1], [2] synthesize a baseband spatial notch impedance and translate it to RF by passive mixers. However, this technique cannot be directly applied at mm-wave frequencies as the impedance translational performance of the passive mixers degrades significantly. Hence, the mm-wave beamformer in [3] realizes a cascadable SNF at an intermediate frequency (IF). However, the front-end mm-wave components like mixers and phase shifters have to tolerate strong blockers, thus degrading RX linearity. Besides, it uses multiple IF buffers and VGAs for signal scaling and combining, which could be power-hungry if a similar method is adopted to realize a mm-wave SNF. To improve on those limitations, we propose a scalable SNF structure, which (1) suppresses the strongest in-band blocker at mm-wave frequencies, (2) supports N-input-N-output MIMOs, and (3) requires no active blocks except the phase shifters. A two-step autonomous notch-steering technique is also developed to adjust the SNF notch direction power-efficiently and accurately.","title":"A 23-to-29GHz Receiver with mm-Wave N-Input-N-Output Spatial Notch Filtering and Autonomous Notch-Steering Achieving 20-to-40dB mm-Wave Spatial Rejection and -14dBm In-Notch IP1 dB"}},{"docId":"695","weight":0.17232055939929883,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Low-cost, energy efficient, high-capacity, scalable, and easy-to-deploy point-to-point wireless links at mm-waves find a variety of applications including data intensive systems (e.g., data centers), interactive kiosks, and many emerging applications requiring data pipelines.

The idea of a secure directional wireless link between a TX\/RX pair is to preserve the signal information within a secure cone where the intended receiver is located while scrambling signals everywhere else to prevent eavesdropping. In a phased array, the same temporal digital information is fed to all the TX elements, transmitting the same information to all directions albeit at different power levels. This information can be recovered (especially at the side lobes) with a sensitive enough receiver. Spatial modulation with I, Q radiated out through separate antennas, and modulation of parasitic elements can distort the constellation in other directions [3], [4].

To minimize the bitcell area of the high-density SRAM bitcell, the number of fins (setting the channel width, W) of the pull-up PMOS (PU), passgate NMOS (PG) and pull-down NMOS (PD) transistors must be selected as 1:1:1. Since PU, PG, and PD have the same channel length (L), the ratio in geometry between the PU transistor and the PG transistor is equal to one. With the process variations, the strength of PU transistor can be much stronger than the PG transistor. A stronger PU transistor increases read stability of the SRAM bitcell but it degrades the write margin significantly and results in worse write-V DDMIN  issue. Figure 13.5.1(a) shows a contention condition between PU and PG transistors of a 6T-SRAM bitcell for the write operation.

Achieving high linearity without reducing the output amplitude is key to preserve high SNR, which is tightened by the intrinsic 1\/3 eye amplitude reduction. Moreover, transitions between non-adjacent levels reduce horizontal eye openings, demanding wide bandwidth and tight timing constraints. In light of the above issues, pushing the transmitter to high data-rates while maintaining signal integrity and energy efficiency is challenging. In fact, published PAM-4 transmitters [25] do not meet the CEI-56G-PAM4 standard [1], requiring up to 56Gb\/s and 4-taps of feedforward equalization (FFE). To reach the target, improvements on both the architecture and the circuit side are required. A serializer architecture is presented in this paper. To save power, clocking signals are generated and distributed at quarter-rate, but the last stage employs 21 multiplexers (MUXs) driven by half-rate clocks generated locally to overcome the speed limitation of 41 MUXs. Moreover, a new current-mode driver allows high swing and good linearity by raising the power supply without compromising speed and reliability, and a double T-coil splits transistors and ESD parasitics to meet the bandwidth requirements for the target data rate.","title":"6.4 A 64Gb\/s PAM-4 transmitter with 4-Tap FFE and 2.26pJ\/b energy efficiency in 28nm CMOS FDSOI"}},{"docId":"736","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"With the proliferation of the Internet of Things and mobile computing, network speed is accelerating to support data-rich services.

CMOS TIAs using the shunt-feedback (SF) topology (Fig. 12.2.1) have recently been shown to achieve adequate noise and bandwidth performance to facilitate 100Gb\/s receivers [14]. However, the SF- TIA suffers from debilitating tradeoffs between its noise and bandwidth, which make it fundamentally challenging to improve noise\/bandwidth performance beyond what has already been achieved. An alternative that has the potential to overcome the fundamental shortcomings of the single-ended (SE) SF-TIA is a differential TIA. Recognizing that the SE-SF-TIA only uses the photo-current flowing out of one terminal of the photodiode (PD), a differential TIA seeks to double the signal current by using the current coming out of the PD's other terminal (Fig. 12.2.1). As the PD current also flows in the complementary branch, the signal increases by 6dB at the cost of a 3dB increase in noise, resulting in a theoretical 3dB increase in SNR. However, achieving this 3dB SNR improvement in practice is difficult. To understand the reasons behind it, consider the conventional differential TIA as shown in Fig. 12.2.1. It employs capacitively coupled signal paths to bring the PD current to the TIAs. Resistors  R_B1(R_B2)  are used to reverse bias the PD and need to be chosen such that the corner frequency  (F_c)  of the high-pass filter formed by  R_B1C_C1(R_B2C_C2)  is low enough to pass the low-frequency components of the PAM-4 data. However, the maximum value of  R_B1(R_B2)  is limited by the tolerable voltage drop caused by the average PD current. For example, even a  300A  average current with  R_B1=R_B2=20k  would entail a 6V drop, which is prohibitively large in fine-line CMOS processes. In [5], the bias resistor was replaced by a regulator to alleviate the voltage headroom issue. But this approach is severely limited by the conflicting regulator output impedance  (R_OUT)  requirements: achieving a low  F_c  requires a large  R_OUT ; achieving good line\/load regulation and power supply rejection (PSR) mandates a low  R_OUT  Even if  R_OUT  is made as high as  20k  and  C_C1=C_C2=20pF , the high-pass corner would be nearly 400kHz, which is about an order of magnitude higher than what is needed for low baseline wander. Consequently, further increasing  C_C1\/C_C2  is the only viable option for lowering  F_c  However, the top\/bottom plate parasitic capacitors  C_PT\/C_PB  of the coupling capacitors severely degrade the TIA performance in two critical ways. First, they shunt the photocurrent, significantly reducing the signal current flowing into the TIA and lowering the effective transimpedance at high frequencies. Second, they add to the TIA input capacitance, reducing the TIA bandwidth and increasing its noise [6]. Because of these drawbacks, practical differential TIA performance is not superior to an SE-TIA.","title":"A 7 pA\/Hz Asymmetric Differential TIA for 100Gb\/s PAM-4 links with 14dBm Optical Sensitivity in 16nm CMOS"}},{"docId":"1180","weight":0.5742225447420962,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"DSP-based transceivers above 100Gb\/s have demonstrated the ability to handle up to 38dB insertion loss (IL) with low-to-moderate crosstalk [2].

In this context the choice between a so-called analog mixed signal (AMS) SerDes architecture vs. an ADC-DSP-based one has been debated at length. AMS provides significantly lower maximum power [2, 4] while ADC-DSP provides higher link margin [1] thus avoiding expensive and power hungry repeater ICs that largely negate the power advantage of AMS SerDes in a system. AMS provides an easier and cheaper approach to implement multi-tap DFEs [3] compared to DSP where it is typically very expensive to implement more than a 1-tap DFE.

Typically, a continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) and a multi-tap decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) are implemented in a mixed-signal receiver (RX). However, when the data rate reaches 112Gb\/s, the implementation of the DFE suffers from stringent feedback timing. Direct DFE works only at 100Gb\/s in an optical receiver [1], leaving no room for feedforward error correction (FEC). A speculative 1 - tap DFE is implemented in [2], but it requires an 8-tap feedforward equalizer (FFE) at the transmitter (TX) to generate a 1+0.5D response; this may be impractical without knowing the characteristics of the entire channel. Another drawback of a speculative DFE is the large 1 st -tap latency, which brings about challenges in realizing two or more taps. In addition, the DFE does not compensate for pre-cursor inter-symbol interference (ISI), which becomes significant for channels with higher loss. Without a DFE, the CTLE only covers a small loss of up to 10dB [3,4].

This paper describes a 125 two-dimensional optical I\/O array for 600 Gb\/s, utilizing 60 channels, each with an operating speed of 10Gb\/s. The physical limitation in the number of channels is relaxed by connecting the LDDs through vias to the VCSELs placed on the opposite side of the interposer. The arrangement of the RX, in relation to the two-dimensional photo detector (PD) and TIA array, is the same as the TX. Key elements of each channel are the LDD consuming 2.17 mW\/Gb\/s and the TIA that consumes 0.96 mW\/Gb\/s while achieving an input-referred noise of 0.95 A rms . The low power of the LDD and TIA improve the package reliability while the high sensitivity of the TIA enables the transmission via a long optical waveguide.","title":"8.2 A 125 two-dimensional optical I\/O array for 600Gb\/s chip-to-chip interconnect in 65nm CMOS"}},{"docId":"10","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"The recent revolution in handheld computing with high-speed cellular network made mobile processors have multi-cores and powerful 3D graphic engines that support FHD (19201080) or even higher resolutions.

To minimize the bitcell area of the high-density SRAM bitcell, the number of fins (setting the channel width, W) of the pull-up PMOS (PU), passgate NMOS (PG) and pull-down NMOS (PD) transistors must be selected as 1:1:1. Since PU, PG, and PD have the same channel length (L), the ratio in geometry between the PU transistor and the PG transistor is equal to one. With the process variations, the strength of PU transistor can be much stronger than the PG transistor. A stronger PU transistor increases read stability of the SRAM bitcell but it degrades the write margin significantly and results in worse write-V DDMIN  issue. Figure 13.5.1(a) shows a contention condition between PU and PG transistors of a 6T-SRAM bitcell for the write operation.

However, low performance\/energy-efficiency of LAE thin-film transistors (TFTs) necessitates hybrid systems, integrating Si-CMOS ICs for system functions (sensor readout\/control, processing, etc.). Initial work shows that a primary challenge in hybrid systems is the large number of interfaces required between LAE and CMOS, particularly as the number of sensors scales [1,2]. This paper presents a force-sensing system that exploits signal sparsity exhibited in many large-area tactile-sensing applications (e.g., detecting point damage\/stress in structures [3]), to reduce interfacing complexity to the level of sparsity, rather than a level related to the number of sensors (e.g., [1]). This is achieved via compressed sensing (CS), enabling sensor-acquisition by simple switches, readily implemented using TFTs. While CS has previously been leveraged in a hybrid-system architecture targeting signal sampling-rate requirements [2], this system applies it for high spatial resolution in tactile sensing.","title":"17.3 Hybrid System for Efficient LAE-CMOS Interfacing in Large-Scale Tactile-Sensing Skins via TFT-Based Compressed Sensing"}},{"docId":"883","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"As the demand for high frame rate and SNR increases in capacitive touch systems (CTSs), several driving methods have been reported [1], [5].

This paper presents a virtual rotating gesture-recognition IC (VRGR-IC) on a bezel area for a wearable device employing a circular display. For an implementation of the VRGR, the sensors should be placed below the bezel. However, the bracket to assemble the display and main body of a wearable device makes it unable to place any sensors in that position, as shown in the top of Fig. 26.2.1. To alternatively implement that function, two key features of this work include: 1) an integrated capacitive touch and VRGR system, which enables traditional 2-D touch sensing on a display's active area and near-field 3-D hover gesture on the bezel area, and 2) a haptic generating system, which provides continual haptic feedback responsive to a finger rotation. More specifically, the bottom of Fig. 26.2.1 shows the operational principle of the VRGR system, which incorporates a touch-screen panel (TSP), VRGR-IC, AMOLED display, display driver IC (DDl), application processor (AP), and linear resonant actuator (LRA). When the TSP is touched, the VRGR IC extracts both the touch coordinates  (_1,_1) (_,_)  of multi-finger as well as an angle of rotation on a bezel by a finger.

Recently, there has been an attempt to adopt 2-D self-capacitance multi-touch sensors in flexible OLEDs over 10 in size to reduce capacitive loads. Due to encapsulation of thickness less than  10m , capacitive loads over 500pF are formed under the conventional bar-type sensor. Nevertheless, there remain problems with limited signal bandwidth, large offset charge, and severe common display noise injection due to a large capacitive load.

Therefore, it is expected to achieve better performance with lower SRAM V DDMIN . However, the quantized sizing of the channel width and length has drawbacks for conventional 6T-SRAM bitcell scaling. To minimize the bitcell area of the high-density SRAM bitcell, the number of fins (setting the channel width, W) of the pull-up PMOS (PU), passgate NMOS (PG) and pull-down NMOS (PD) transistors must be selected as 1:1:1. Since PU, PG, and PD have the same channel length (L), the ratio in geometry between the PU transistor and the PG transistor is equal to one. With the process variations, the strength of PU transistor can be much stronger than the PG transistor. A stronger PU transistor increases read stability of the SRAM bitcell but it degrades the write margin significantly and results in worse write-V DDMIN  issue. Figure 13.5.1(a) shows a contention condition between PU and PG transistors of a 6T-SRAM bitcell for the write operation. During the write operation, the PU transistor impedes the ability of the PG transistor to pull the storage node (S) from V DD  to ground. The bitcell may suffer a write failure at the stronger PU with weaker PG condition caused by the device variations. Two techniques have been proposed to improve the high density SRAM bitcell write V DDMIN : 1) negative bit-line voltage (NBL) to increase the strength of PG transistor and 2) lower cell V DD  (LCV) to weaken PU transistor strength [1-5]. Compared to the conventional techniques, this work develops a suppressed-coupling-signal negative bitline (SCS-NBL) scheme and a write-recovery-enhancement lower-cell-V DD  (WRE-LCV) scheme for write assist without the concern of reliability at higher V DD  operating region.

A global clock requires costly full-chip margining and significant power and area for clock distribution, while synchronizing data FIFOs add power, performance, and area overhead per clock crossing.

Ideally, the TR should be in excess of one octave, since this allows the easy synthesis of all frequencies below those directly generated by the VCOs via repeated frequency divisions by 2. At the same time, the oscillation spectrum should be affected as little as possible by spurious (common-mode) magnetic fields impinging on the inductor coil in the VCO tank. This is a crucial requirement in modern radios, where there are more PLLs active at the same time, and particularly when (non-contiguous) carrier aggregation is implemented, since in this case the signal bands may be very close to each other. If an individual PLL is used for each band, the VCOs may oscillate very close to each other, or at frequencies that are harmonically related to each other, posing a very serious issue of mutual pulling through the respective magnetic field.

SNR at low-light conditions, which is a key performance metric, is determined by the sensitivity and crosstalk in pixels. To improve sensitivity, pixel technology has migrated from frontside illumination (FSI) to backside illumiation (BSI) as pixel size shrinks down. In BSI technology, it is very difficult to further increase the sensitivity in a pixel of near-1.0m size because there are no structural obstacles for incident light from micro-lens to photodiode. Therefore the only way to improve low-light SNR is to reduce crosstalk, which makes the non-diagonal elements of the color-correction matrix (CCM) close to zero and thus reduces color noise [3]. The best way to improve crosstalk is to introduce a complete physical isolation between neighboring pixels, e.g., using deep-trench isolation (DTI). So far, a few attempts using DTI have been made to suppress silicon crosstalk. A backside DTI in as small as 1.12m-pixel, which is formed in the BSI process, is reported in [4], but it is just an intermediate step in the DTI-related technology because it cannot completely prevent silicon crosstalk, especially for long wavelengths of light. On the other hand, front-side DTIs for FSI pixels [5] and BSI pixels [6] are reported. In [5], however, DTI is present not only along the periphery of each pixel, but also invades into the pixel so that it is inefficient in terms of gathering incident light and providing sufficient amount of photodiode area. In [6], the pixel size is as large as 2.0m and it is hard to scale down with this technology for near 1.0m pitch because DTI width imposes a critical limit on the sufficient amount of photodiode area for full-well capacity. Thus, a new technological advance is necessary to realize the ideal front DTI in a small size pixel near 1.0m.","title":"7.1 A 1\/4-inch 8Mpixel CMOS image sensor with 3D backside-illuminated 1.12m pixel with front-side deep-trench isolation and vertical transfer gate"}},{"docId":"61","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Despite versatility and low power consumption, direct-conversion transmitters suffer from a fundamental drawback: the local oscillator disturbance by the power amplifier, through unwanted electromagnetic or capacitive coupling [1,2].

However, current active matrix OLED (AMOLED) displays on foil do not validate this power-efficient advantage, as too much power is lost in the AM backplane. AMOLED displays use the analog voltage on the gate of a drive transistor (e.g. M1 in Fig. 30.2.1) to control the pixel current and hence the pixel brightness. Accurate and uniform pixel currents can only be obtained when transistor M1 is driven is saturation. In highresolution technologies on foil, transistor parameters W, L and the mobility  are limited by technology, imposing a minimal V GS -V T  to obtain sufficient current, i.e. V GS -V T  > 4V for a-IGZO on foil [1]. Subsequently, to obtain saturation, V DS  > 4V, which translates in a static backplane power loss surpassing the OLED power consumption (see red stars in Fig 30.2.1). However, when the OLED pixel impedance around a specific reference current can be matched along a display column line, the accurate pixel current control can be imposed by current DACs implemented in external silicon display column drivers. In this work, we operate M1 as a switch and pixel intensity variations are obtained using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) of a predefined pixel current, i.e. 2A\/pixel [8080m 2 ] (which corresponds in our OLED technology to a light output of 2000Cd\/m 2 ). When, in a future implementation the external DACs are calibrated at 0.2A\/pixel, the full brightness would correspond to the typical display brightness of a portable PC, i.e. 200Cd\/m 2 . This concept enables us to reduce the display power voltage at full brightness from 8.2V in a classical AMOLED display on foil configuration to 5V (measured) and for future implementations even down to 4V (see Fig. 30.2.1). As the OLED current load remains equal, a corresponding static power reduction of the display (and increased battery lifetime) is obtained. Digital driving methods of AMOLED displays have been shown before. However,  techniques [2] still integrate charge packets on the gate of M1 and hence do not solve the power issue on foil. Other PWM techniques [3] activate only a single active line in the linedriver yielding difficulties to obtain color depths above 6 bits. When multiple independent linedrivers are implemented and their output is multiplexed to alternately drive a single select line, a higher color depth can be obtained [4].

However, conventional DRAM devices such as DDR4 DIMM and GDDR5 cannot satisfy these needs since they are bandwidth limited to less than 30GB\/s. Also, if multiple GDDR DRAMs are used simultaneously for higher bandwidth, then high power consumption and routing congestion on PCBs become a big concern. In order to overcome these limitations, the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) DRAM was recently introduced[1]. HBM-DRAM uses TSV and interposer technologies enabling multiple chip stacks and wide I\/Os between the processor and memory: providing high capacity, low power and high bandwidth. This paper proposes the 2nd generation HBM to double the bandwidth from 128GB\/s to more than 256GB\/s and support pseudo-channel mode and 8H stacks [2]. In the pseudo-channel mode, a legacy channel is divided into two pseudo channels and the two pseudo channels share the command-address pins. Thus, one HBM has 16 pseudo channels instead of 8 legacy channels. To support various stack configurations including 8H stacks, a new architecture is adopted for flexible density ranging from 16Gb to 64Gb maintaining the same bandwidth. Finally, the bandwidth increase requires an active thermal solution to manage hotspots that develop from highly concentrated power consumption; we propose an adaptive refresh considering temperature distribution (ART) scheme as a solution.","title":"18.2 A 1.2V 20nm 307GB\/s HBM DRAM with at-speed wafer-level I\/O test scheme and adaptive refresh considering temperature distribution"}},{"docId":"30","weight":0.3443359622779674,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Requirements for high bandwidth and low power continue to increase in servers and consumer electronics.

Source-series termination (SST) drivers, which are widely used in FFE TXs, provide good linearity and good impedance matching; however, the linear resistors occupy too much area and add significant parasitic capacitance, thereby dissipating additional power [1] (Fig. 28.4.1).

For example, replacing SST drivers in a conventional FFE (C-FFE) with inverters results in the pull-up PMOSs and pull-down NMOSs to turn on simultaneously during FFE tap subtraction.

Conventional HBM interfaces use a termination-less structure at the receiver to reduce power consumption. For higher data rates receiver-side termination can be used to improve signal integrity. However, this causes a large static current for long consecutive identical digits (CID). Di-code signaling can be used in HBM interfaces to reduce this static current.

Even in digital PLLs, which rely on a digital loop filter, the bandwidth still depends on the gains of two mixed-signal building blocks, namely the time\/digital converter (TDC) and the digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO), that have conversion characteristics that are not well-controlled. The situation is even more cumbersome employing a singlebit TDC, often referred to as bang-bang phase detector (BBPD), where the linearized gain is inversely proportional to the input jitter [1]. An accurate and repeatable value of the PLL bandwidth, and in the general of the frequency response, is essential to meet several specifications, such as stability margin, settling time, jitter and spur level. When the PLL is operated as a direct frequency modulator with pre-emphasis of the modulation signal, the accuracy requirement of the frequency response is even more demanding [2]. Previously disclosed methods to control PLL bandwidth require a modulation signal to be injected into the loop [2], compensate the gain variations of just a single block (e.g., VCO [3] or BBPD [4]), or operate in the foreground [5]. This paper presents a digital PLL employing a digital background normalization of loop gain, which makes it independent of any analog variable (except for the reference frequency, which often is available from an accurate source).

To minimize the bitcell area of the high-density SRAM bitcell, the number of fins (setting the channel width, W) of the pull-up PMOS (PU), passgate NMOS (PG) and pull-down NMOS (PD) transistors must be selected as 1:1:1. Since PU, PG, and PD have the same channel length (L), the ratio in geometry between the PU transistor and the PG transistor is equal to one. With the process variations, the strength of PU transistor can be much stronger than the PG transistor. A stronger PU transistor increases read stability of the SRAM bitcell but it degrades the write margin significantly and results in worse write-V DDMIN  issue. Figure 13.5.1(a) shows a contention condition between PU and PG transistors of a 6T-SRAM bitcell for the write operation. During the write operation, the PU transistor impedes the ability of the PG transistor to pull the storage node (S) from V DD  to ground. The bitcell may suffer a write failure at the stronger PU with weaker PG condition caused by the device variations. Two techniques have been proposed to improve the high density SRAM bitcell write V DDMIN : 1) negative bit-line voltage (NBL) to increase the strength of PG transistor and 2) lower cell V DD  (LCV) to weaken PU transistor strength [1-5].

Furthermore, the complementary nature allows deep Class-AB operation, giving a high power efficiency at power back-off comparable to state-of-the-art 60GHz PA structures based on NMOS only.","title":"14.3 A Push-Pull mm-Wave power amplifier with <0.8 AM-PM distortion in 40nm CMOS"}},{"docId":"46","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"An FPGA employing c-axis aligned crystal In-Ga-Zn oxide (CAAC-IGZO) FET [1] based configuration memories (CMs) is known to need no reconfiguration thanks to nonvolatile CMs, shows high operation speed due to boosting effect of pass gates used in routing switches (RS) [2], and easily realizes fine-grained multi-context (FG-MC) architecture [2] because CMs which need very low power to keep the contents can be constructed with a small number of transistors.

Ideally, the TR should be in excess of one octave, since this allows the easy synthesis of all frequencies below those directly generated by the VCOs via repeated frequency divisions by 2. At the same time, the oscillation spectrum should be affected as little as possible by spurious (common-mode) magnetic fields impinging on the inductor coil in the VCO tank. This is a crucial requirement in modern radios, where there are more PLLs active at the same time, and particularly when (non-contiguous) carrier aggregation is implemented, since in this case the signal bands may be very close to each other. If an individual PLL is used for each band, the VCOs may oscillate very close to each other, or at frequencies that are harmonically related to each other, posing a very serious issue of mutual pulling through the respective magnetic field.

SNR at low-light conditions, which is a key performance metric, is determined by the sensitivity and crosstalk in pixels. To improve sensitivity, pixel technology has migrated from frontside illumination (FSI) to backside illumiation (BSI) as pixel size shrinks down. In BSI technology, it is very difficult to further increase the sensitivity in a pixel of near-1.0m size because there are no structural obstacles for incident light from micro-lens to photodiode. Therefore the only way to improve low-light SNR is to reduce crosstalk, which makes the non-diagonal elements of the color-correction matrix (CCM) close to zero and thus reduces color noise [3]. The best way to improve crosstalk is to introduce a complete physical isolation between neighboring pixels, e.g., using deep-trench isolation (DTI). So far, a few attempts using DTI have been made to suppress silicon crosstalk. A backside DTI in as small as 1.12m-pixel, which is formed in the BSI process, is reported in [4], but it is just an intermediate step in the DTI-related technology because it cannot completely prevent silicon crosstalk, especially for long wavelengths of light. On the other hand, front-side DTIs for FSI pixels [5] and BSI pixels [6] are reported. In [5], however, DTI is present not only along the periphery of each pixel, but also invades into the pixel so that it is inefficient in terms of gathering incident light and providing sufficient amount of photodiode area. In [6], the pixel size is as large as 2.0m and it is hard to scale down with this technology for near 1.0m pitch because DTI width imposes a critical limit on the sufficient amount of photodiode area for full-well capacity. Thus, a new technological advance is necessary to realize the ideal front DTI in a small size pixel near 1.0m.","title":"7.1 A 1\/4-inch 8Mpixel CMOS image sensor with 3D backside-illuminated 1.12m pixel with front-side deep-trench isolation and vertical transfer gate"}},{"docId":"61","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Despite versatility and low power consumption, direct-conversion transmitters suffer from a fundamental drawback: the local oscillator disturbance by the power amplifier, through unwanted electromagnetic or capacitive coupling [1,2].

If the free-running frequency, FFR, of the oscillator is tuned close to NF REF  (N=4, in Fig. 10.6.1), injected pulses phase lock the oscillator and greatly suppress its close-in phase noise.

However, ILCMs have been fundamentally limited to only integer-N operation and cannot be used for fractional-N frequency synthesis. To understand this limitation, consider the ILCM waveforms shown in Fig. 10.6.1 when FFR is initially tuned to the desired fractional frequency of (N+)F REF  (N=4 and =0.25 in the example). Because injection takes place only on the positive edge of reference clock, phase difference between injection pulse and the oscillator output, E, grows rapidly at a rate of 0.25T OSC \/T REF .

To suppress large phase noise (PN) and supply sensitivity, a Type-III PLL was proposed to provide a large low-frequency loop gain by using a 3 rd -order feedback loop [1].

Thus, multiphase clocks are typically utilized in DRAMs to relax timing margins because of the reduced timing budget. However, phase errors between multiphase clocks, due to device mismatch, degrade the valid data sampling window. To reduce phase error, several multiphase correction schemes have been proposed [1]-[4]. The active poly-phase filter-based open-loop scheme exhibits a small RMS jitter contribution, but the remaining phase error after the error correction is considerably varied and large in its operating frequency range [1]. A distributed delay-locked loop (DLL) [2] offers the smallest RMS jitter, but the residual phase error is non-negligible as well due to the mismatch of error detection circuits in each calibration loop. The phase error corrector with a relaxation oscillator-based phase detector is also susceptible to the mismatch [3]. The digital DLL-based scheme adopts a shared digital feedback loop to eliminate the effect of mismatch [4]. However, it shows a larger RMS jitter contribution than the distributed DLL due to quantization noise and the increased clock path delay. Since the delay of in-phase clock is always fixed at the mid-point, overall set of codes of digitally-controlled delay lines (DCDLs) may not be at their optimum in terms of jitter. Because jitter and total delay of clock paths are increased more than necessary, it leads to degradation of the data eye. In this paper, an improved quadrature error corrector (QEC), the calibration of which starts from the minimum delay code over all DCDLs, is proposed along with an asynchronous and seamless-calibration on-off scheme for the reduction of power consumption in the operating state after calibration.","title":"22.6 A 0.8-to-2.3GHz Quadrature Error Corrector with Correctable Error Range of 101.6ps Using Minimum Total Delay Tracking and Asynchronous Calibration On-Off Scheme for DRAM Interface"}},{"docId":"1028","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"We present a 0.4-to-6.5GHz Frequency Locked Loop (FLL) implemented in 10nm CMOS, targeting high performance SoCs that require uninterrupted, overshoot-free clocks for Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS).

Currently, the use of a digital-to-time converter (DTC) to cancel the quantization noise (Q-noise) is popular, but fractional spurs due to the nonlinearity of the DTC (NL DTC ) are a critical problem, especially for RO-DPLLs that require a wide bandwidth to suppress the RO jitter. The piecewise linearization of the DTC code can compensate for this NL DTC  [1], but its effectiveness has a tradeoff with design resources. The time-invariant probability modulation (TIPM) [2] at the top of Fig. 32.1.1 is another method to cope with NLDTC. It uses a property that, if the DTC code is modulated such that its probability density function (PDF) is time-invariant (TI), the expected value of the output is constant even after experiencing NLDTC so that the generation of fractional spurs can be avoided. However, since the TIPM avoids spurs by spreading out their noise power, it cannot reduce the rms jitter (or IPN) itself. Moreover, the TIPM is valid only for NL DTC  since its TI property is nullified when the two DTC paths are merged. Therefore, it is still vulnerable to the spurs caused by the interaction of the Q-noise, which could remain after the DTCs or be coupled directly through substrate\/supply, with the nonlinearities of other circuits (NL OC ), and that includes the effects of parasitics and bond wires. The bottom of Fig. 32.1.1 shows that the TIPM effectively avoids spurs due to NL DTC , but the IPN remains the same (left).

However, this high-gain operation of a sample-and-hold circuit (SH) also has a downside that makes it difficult to achieve a fractional resolution. This is because the quantization error (Q-error) due to the non-integer relationship between the reference frequency, fREF, and the VCO frequency, f VCO , easily makes sampling points fall outside the linear range of the SH. Thus, to have a fractional resolution, SSPLLs must have a dedicated method for cancelling the Q-error. The top left of Fig. 32.4.1 shows a time-domain Q-error cancellation (TD-QEC) that is currently popular [1]. As a digital-to-time converter (DTC) cancels the Q-error, the VCO output, S VCO , can be continuously sampled at high-K SH  points in the steady state. However, a critical problem is that, since the DTC is located at the front, its thermal noise cannot be suppressed by K SH  degrading the in-band phase noise (PN) of SSPLLs. In contrast, in reference-sampling PLLs (RSPLLs) [2,3], the divided signal of the S VCO  samples the reference clock, SREF. However, they have a fundamental limit to achieve a low jitter since their K SH  is much smaller than that of SSPLLs while the thermal noise of the DTC is still high.","title":"32.4 A 104fsrms-Jitter and -61dBc-Fractional Spur 15GHz Fractional-N Subsampling PLL Using a Voltage-Domain Quantization-Error Cancelation Technique"}},{"docId":"1312","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"With the increasing demand for low-power, high-speed DRAMs, LPDDR5 featuring a speed of 6.4Gb\/s has recently been announced [1].

Conventional CDN SIJ coping methods use supply voltage regulators and decoupling capacitors. Unfortunately, a supply regulator is not suitable for low-voltage mobile DRAM due to the required drop-out voltage headroom, while the decoupling capacitor cannot sufficiently filter low-frequency noise without requiring excessive area.

While injection locking widens the noise-suppression bandwidth of an RO-based phase-locked loop (PLL) [2], its effectiveness to overall jitter is limited only to those with low multiplication factors. By exploiting the accumulation-free nature of jitter in delay-locked loops [3], the reference multiplier in [4] generates a clean mid-frequency clock and then is cascaded to a high-frequency PLL, achieving a low output jitter despite a high multiplication factor. However, the background calibration for the large delay errors in the reference multiplier due to process, supply voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations necessitates an excessive settling time, which is in the order of a few milliseconds at worst. While the reference multiplier in [5] achieves very low noise, its calibration, which also requires a long settling time, should be preceded by a post-fabrication trimming.

As a matter of fact, fast-hopping ADPLLs using multibit TDCs have been demonstrated in applications with relaxed jitter specifications [2], [3]. To break the trade-off between frequency agility and jitter-power product, auxiliary frequency-acquisition loops have been recently adopted in BBPLL architectures [1], [4], [5]. Those auxiliary loops, based on extra BBPDs, control the digitally-controlled-oscillator (DCO) frequency with a gain larger than that of the main loop, thus decreasing the settling time. Unfortunately, above a certain control-gain value, the system nonlinearity introduces an unwanted dependence between the main and auxiliary loops, limiting locking time to several thousands of reference cycles.","title":"A 68.6fsrms-total-integrated-jitter and 1.56s-locking-time fractional-N bang-bang PLL based on type-II gear shifting and adaptive frequency switching"}},{"docId":"418","weight":0.8128398335135747,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"A multiplying delay-locked loop (MDLL) is an attractive architecture for a low-jitter clock generator, as it does not suffer much from jitter accumulation [1-4].

In CDR-based systems, a global phase-locked loop generates a low-noise, differential clock and distributes it to each lane, where a local phase adjuster, consisting of a multi-phase clock generator and phase interpolators (PIs), compensates the frequency and phase errors between the incoming data and quadrature clocks; while in a forwarded-clock system, the forwarded clock from the transmitter is adjusted by a delay line for phase deskew and the MPCG generates multiple phases for the ADCs. Multi-phase injection-locked ring oscillators (MPILOSCs) [1,2] provide accurate, low-noise, multi-phase clocks thanks to their wide locking range and symmetric structure, but generating the multi-phase injection signals with a poly-phase filter [1] or from a double\/quadruple frequency [2] is power-hungry. Also, the circuits in [1,2] lack calibration for ROSC free-running frequency (f osc ) variations over PVT. Two-phase (0 and 180) IL-ROSCs with a quadrature-locked loop (OLL) are low-power, low-area MPCGs for PIs [3-5]; differential clocks are injected into the ROSC, while the OLL adjusts the ROSC biasing to suppress the IO output error, assuming that when the f osc  = f inj , the injection frequency, the smallest IO output error and the widest ROSC noise suppression bandwidth are obtained for a given injection strength. However, simulations (Fig. 11.4.2) show that the smallest IO error occurs when f osc  is near the lower edge of the locking range due to the imbalance introduced by two-phase injection, while the optimum jitter point remains at f osc  = f inj . As a result, when using a OLL, the injection strength has to be increased to get a sufficiently large noise suppression bandwidth. However, the stronger injection degrades the amplitude and slope balance between stages with injection, and stages without injection, which degrades the phase accuracy. In a OLL-based architecture, there is a tradeoff among IO accuracy, jitter, and power consumption.","title":"11.4 A High-Accuracy Multi-Phase Injection-Locked 8-Phase 7GHz Clock Generator in 65nm with 7b Phase Interpolators for High-Speed Data Links"}},{"docId":"419","weight":0.6483510489419168,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Today's multicore processors and complex multimedia SoCs incorporate power management techniques such as dynamic frequency scaling (DFS), which dynamically changes operating frequencies, and dynamic core-count scaling (DCCS), which rapidly power cycles the cores between active and idle states.

Given their potential use as carrier frequencies for the next-generation mobiles (i.e., beyond 5G), these W-band signals must have ultra-low phase noise (PN). Currently, the most popular solution to generate such frequencies is with a cascaded architecture: a first-stage PLL generates a low-PN signal at a relatively low frequency at which the VCO LC tank has a high Q factor, and following frequency multipliers (FMs) increase the frequency to the W-band [1]. Although various FMs have been proposed, all of them are limited in their ability to achieve a high multiplication factor, M. Push-push or harmonic-selection circuits have high conversion losses. Injection-locked FMs (ILFMs) require multiple stages due to their narrow lock ranges, which increase power consumption and complexity. Thus, single-stage direct PLLs [2-4] would be preferred if they could have a sufficiently wide loop bandwidth to suppress the poor PN of a W-band VCO. Subsampling PLLs (SSPLLs) are suitable for extending the bandwidth since they have low in-band PN due to the high phase-error ( ERR ) detection gain of a subsampling phase detector (PD). Nevertheless, when SSPLLs operate in the W-band, the degradation of PN is unavoidable because the  ERR  detection gain decreases as the frequency of the VCO, f VCO , increases. As described at the left of Fig. 23.4.1, when the switch of the PD, SWPD, is closed, the output of the PD, SPD, should track the signal of the VCO, S VCO , closely. However, when f VCO  increases to the W-band, the amplitude of SPD is reduced significantly by a parasitic pole that is present due to the turned-on resistance of SW PD , R ON , and the sampling capacitor, CS. When SWPD is turned off,  ERR  is detected in SPD, but its magnitude is already suppressed significantly relative to that in SVCO.

Thus, in general, an ILCM must be equipped with a dedicated PVT-calibrator to mitigate the sensitivity of its performance to PVT variations. One of the most general calibration methods is to use a phase-locked loop (PLL). This method can correct static frequency deviations of a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) due to process variations, but it cannot prevent real-time frequency drifts due to temperature or voltage variations [1].

In [1-3], frequency drifts were monitored by a replica-VCO or a delay-locked loop (DLL) that used the same delay cells as the main VCO. However, in these architectures, each calibrator must spend the same amount of the power as the VCO. In addition, mismatches between delay cells limit the calibrating precision or demand an additional calibrating step.

For example, dynamic frequency scaling (DFS) saves processor power, spread spectrum clocking (SSC) reduces electromagnetic interference (EMI), and rapid power cycling between idle and active states allows energy-proportional operation. A conventional analog integer-N phase-locked loop (PLL)-based clock generation unit (CGU) occupies large area, has a long lock time, and its output frequency resolution is limited by the reference clock frequency.

A big challenge of a 5G transceiver is to generate ultra-low-PN (phase noise) local-oscillator (LO) signals to suppress integrated PN (IPN) over such an extremely wide bandwidth. A PLL that directly generates mm-band LO signals is not a good choice due to power-hungry frequency dividers and relatively poor PN. An mm-band LO generator, cascading a GHz-range PLL and a frequency multiplier as shown in Fig. 19.2.1, is an attractive solution. First, a GHz-range PLL can have a higher FOM than a mm-band PLL [1]. Second, the cascaded architecture is naturally able to support the bands for 2G to 4G standards. An injection-locked frequency multiplier (ILFM) is popular in a mm-band, achieving ultra-low PN even in a tight power budget. However, the vulnerability of PN to PVT variations is a critical problem. For an ILFM, the PN performance can be improved only when the free-running VCO frequency, f VCO , and the target frequency are sufficiently close within the lock range, f L , which is very narrow, especially, at high frequencies. To calibrate f VCO  over PVT, many frequency-tracking loops (FTLs) have used a power-hungry circuit (such as a replica-VCO, a TDC, and a counter) operating at f VCO , but they were not suitable for a mm-band ILFM. The sub-sampling FTL [2] used the voltage levels of the VCO outputs, momentarily sampled by injection pulses. However, for the accurate sampling, the pulse width of the injection pulses must be very narrow, since the sampling occurs at the edges of the pulses. For a mm-band VCO, the pulse width must be less than 10ps, but these narrow pulses limit the injection strength and f L . In the mm-band ILFM of [3], the mixers and dividers consumed a lot of power.

This can be done by canceling the predicted instantaneous time offset between the frequency reference (FREF) and the variable oscillator-clock (CKV) edges prior to the PD. There are currently two main cancellation strategies. The first is to align FREF and CKV by inserting a digital-to-time converter (DTC) on either path. However, due to the DTC nonlinearity and its susceptibility to PVT variations, the PLL can suffer from large fractional spurs. Although system-level techniques, e.g., background calibration [1], supply ripple reduction [2], and DTC code randomization [3], can partially alleviate these DTC issues, the overall system complexity worsens. The second method is to convert and cancel the predicted time offset in the voltage domain [4]. This arrangement is less sensitive to PVT variations. However, the accuracy of the time-to-voltage conversion relies on the strict trade-offs between the power consumption, noise, and linearity of a current source. In this work, we introduce a third solution based on a time-mode arithmetic unit (TAU), which outputs a weighted sum of time delays between the (falling) edges of FREF and CKV, as well as between two consecutive CKV edges. Compared with DTC-based solutions, it is less sensitive to PVT variations, as its output merely varies by the ratio of RC time constants, thus ensuring low fractional spurs with no extra system complexity. Compared to the voltage-domain solutions, the absence of a current source is beneficial for phase-noise optimization and migration to more advanced technology nodes. Moreover, TAU can implicitly provide a time-amplification (TA) gain, thus further suppressing the noise of subsequent blocks.","title":"A 2.6-to-4.1GHz Fractional-N Digital PLL Based on a Time-Mode Arithmetic Unit Achieving -249.4dB FoM and -59dBc Fractional Spurs"}},{"docId":"964","weight":0.506008723087377,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Sub-sampling PLLs (SSPLLs) are popular for generating low-jitter output signals.

Meanwhile, an ILFT with such a self-calibration circuit still suffers from a narrow locking range, which cannot support multiband operations. To simplify the system design and meet the multiband requirement, a tuning-less ILFT with an ultra-wide locking range is seen as an appropriate solution for mm-wave multiband 5G applications.","title":"A 22.8-to-43.2GHz tuning-less injection-locked frequency tripler using injection-current boosting with 76.4"}},{"docId":"331","weight":0.40894331208715556,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Multiplying delay-locked loops (MDLLs) are gaining popularity due to their superior noise performance over conventional phase-locked loops (PLLs) [1,2]. Recent designs are trending towards an all-digital implementation that provides advantages such as compact area, good scalability and low power compared to traditional analog implementations. Achieving fractional frequency multiplication is, however, not very straightforward in MDLLs as the digitally controlled oscillator's (DCO's) edge is periodically replaced by a clean reference edge. Recently, a fractional-N MDLL was proposed in [1], where the reference edges are realigned using a digital-to-time converter (DTC). One major drawback of MDLL-based frequency synthesis is that the reference spur is generated at the output spectrum due to the timing mismatch between the phase detection path and reference injection path. One of the contributors to this timing mismatch in fully digital MDLLs is the set-up time of the D flip-flop used for phase detection that creates a static phase-offset between the DCO and reference phase under locked condition. It is very difficult to accurately cancel this offset as any digital phase-detector (PD) or time-to-digital converter (TDC) used for cancellation will have an inherent offset. A spur cancellation technique was proposed in [2] employing a gated ring oscillator (GRO)-based TDC. However, it relies on correlated-double-sampling and requires a high-resolution high-linearity TDC, which increases design complexity and power consumption. Another shortcoming of previous designs is that the timing mismatch measurement was done by looking at the spur in the output spectrum using an extensive high frequency measurement setup. This introduces off-chip measurement error and makes in-situ timing compensation schemes infeasible without a sophisticated testing setup. Furthermore, the frequency domain data must be converted to time domain, which makes it difficult to accurately estimate the exact timing mismatch. This paper proposes an all-digital fractional-N MDLL circuit where fractional-N generation is similar to the injection locking technique proposed in [3], but the advantages of subsampling techniques are utilized, hence removing the frequency divider in the feedback path. This reduces in-band phase noise and lowers power consumption. The same circuit can operate in either MDLL or PLL mode depending on the design requirement. A zero-phase-offset latch-based aperture phase-detector (APD) is designed to match the reference injection path and phase detection path precisely and thereby cancel the spur. Finally, we employ an in-situ timing detection scheme MDLL that directly measures the timing mismatch between the injected reference edge and different DCO edges, providing accurate time-domain data for MDLL characterization and tuning purposes.","title":"19.2 A 0.2-to-1.45GHz subsampling fractional-N all-digital MDLL with zero-offset aperture PD-based spur cancellation and in-situ timing mismatch detection"}},{"docId":"804","weight":0.40472205497326436,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"The next-generation 802.11ax WLAN standard improves the throughput by supporting 1024-QAM in a channel bandwidth of 160MHz, demanding extremely low jitter values for the transmitter (Tx) and the receiver (Rx) synthesizers.

Even in digital PLLs, which rely on a digital loop filter, the bandwidth still depends on the gains of two mixed-signal building blocks, namely the time\/digital converter (TDC) and the digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO), that have conversion characteristics that are not well-controlled. The situation is even more cumbersome employing a singlebit TDC, often referred to as bang-bang phase detector (BBPD), where the linearized gain is inversely proportional to the input jitter [1]. An accurate and repeatable value of the PLL bandwidth, and in the general of the frequency response, is essential to meet several specifications, such as stability margin, settling time, jitter and spur level. When the PLL is operated as a direct frequency modulator with pre-emphasis of the modulation signal, the accuracy requirement of the frequency response is even more demanding [2]. Previously disclosed methods to control PLL bandwidth require a modulation signal to be injected into the loop [2], compensate the gain variations of just a single block (e.g., VCO [3] or BBPD [4]), or operate in the foreground [5]. This paper presents a digital PLL employing a digital background normalization of loop gain, which makes it independent of any analog variable (except for the reference frequency, which often is available from an accurate source).

Conventionally, multiple PLLs are used in SoCs to provide various frequency outputs; however, this method incurs a considerable silicon area, power, cost, and the overall system complexity. Fractional output dividers (FODs), which are composed of a multi-modulus divider (MMD), a digital-to-time converter (DTC), and a digital controller, have been proved to be an effective method for multiple independent clock generation. However, the DTC characteristic is PVT sensitive, and any gain mismatch\/integral nonlinearity (INL) generates large spurs, which degrade spectral purity and clock jitter. The traditional DTC-gain-calibration algorithm, which is widely applied in PLLs, requires a feedback path to reflect DTC-gain mismatch, which prohibits its use in FODs with the open-loop structure. As shown in the upper left of Fig. 14.2.1, an extra complementary-replica DTC  (DTC_c)  is adopted to calibrate DTC gain (Kdtc) [1]. However, the replica DTCs consume large power and area while leading to replica-DTC mismatch concerns, which can seriously degrade the calibration effectiveness. Although the extra replica DTC can be removed by capturing the delay of the  DTC_M  when the digital control word for DTC (Ddcw) equals to 0 and full code alternatively [2]; unfortunately, this method only makes an effective comparison when delta-sigma modulator (DSM) produces an overflow, resulting in a long calibration-convergence time for some frequency-control words (FCWs). Furthermore, neither of the above solutions takes DTC INL into account; thus, the effectiveness of the spur reduction is limited. Extracting a periodic pattern with digital filters and subtracting it from the input FCW is another approach to reduce FOD spurs [3]. Nevertheless, the calibration effectiveness heavily depends on prior knowledge of spur frequencies and needs complex and onerous preliminary measurements. In order to overcome the above-mentioned issues, this paper presents an FOD with an auxiliary-PLL (aux-PLL)-based background  0^th\/1^st\/2^nd -order DTC-INL-calibration scheme.

There has been increasing interest in injecting a low-noise reference clock signal to the RO to refresh the accumulated jitter, as seen in multiplying delay-locked loops (MDLLs) and injection-locked phase-locked loops (1L-pLLs). The main challenge of this architecture is that the injection signal derived from the reference clock is not perfectly aligned with the RO phase at the injection node, hence spurious tones are generated, and this phase alignment issue is especially exacerbated in fractional-N 0peration as the injection time paint must gradually drift away from the reference clock phase [1]. One way of achieving this required phase drift is by tuning digital-to-time converters (DTCs) according to a fractional frequency multiplication ratio; however, DTC offset and gain errors can introduce spurs. Several works have demonstrated DTC calibration, but are either limited to foreground calibration or incur an additional time-to-digital converter (TDC) [2], [3]. To further suppress injection-locking-induced spurs, we propose a background DTC calibration scheme that: 1) simultaneously estimates DTC gain and offset errors by occasional injection squelching; 2) performs two-point gain and offset error correction in the respective analog and digital domains; 3) uses TDC dithering [4] to enhance error estimation accuracy; and 4) removes dithering noise with an adaptive comb-filter-assisted cancellation loop.

While they are most commonly implemented using PLLs, it is becoming increasingly difficult to design them in a power efficient manner, as their jitter requirements grow more stringent. Recognizing that the main limitation of PLLs arises from limited RO noise suppression bandwidth (NBW = F REF \/10), multiplying delay-locked loops (MDLLs) that suppress noise by replacing a RO's noisy edge with a clean reference clock edge have gained prominence [1-3]. Such an edge replacement operation suppresses RO noise with an increased NBW of about F REF \/4 [1]. However, imperfections of edge replacement logic have limited the output frequency of MDLLs [1, 2] or degraded their jitter performance at frequencies beyond 2.5GHz [3]. Furthermore, MDLLs are susceptible to transistor non-idealities and require elaborate analog calibration schemes that are prone to circuit imperfections [2, 3]. In contrast to PLLs and MDLLs, injection-locked clock multipliers (ILCMs) lock RO frequency to an integer multiple (N) of F REF  by injecting narrow pulses at F REF  into the RO whose free running frequency is about NF  REF  [4]. Because ILCMs do not require logic that needs to adhere to stringent timing requirements (like MDLLs) they are better suited for generating high frequencies. However, their jitter performance is limited by: (i) smaller NBW ( F REF \/6) compared to MDLLs, (ii) limited suppression of RO flicker noise due to their Type-I response, and (iii) the need for RO free running frequency, F FR , to be close to NF REF  for maintaining low jitter performance across voltage and temperature. These factors limit the multiplication factor (usually to less than 10) and degrade power efficiency [4,5].

The injection locked oscillator (ILO) based clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit [1-2], is a well-known solution for these demands. The typical solution has at least two oscillators: a master and one or more slaves. The master, a replica of the data path ILO, is part of a phase locked loop (PLL) used to correct the oscillator free-running frequency (FRF). The slave ILO phase locks to the incoming data but uses the frequency control from the master. Any FRF difference between the master and slave, such as that caused by PVT or mismatch, reduces the receiver performance. One solution to the reduced performance [3] uses burst data and corrects the FRF between bursts. However, for continuous data, injection forces the recovered clock frequency to match the incoming data rate, masking any FRF error from the frequency detector. Existing solutions [4-5] use a phase detector (PD) to measure the FRF. However, any static phase offset between the PD lock point and the ILO lock point causes the frequency control algorithm to converge incorrectly. Static phase offset can be caused by mismatch, PVT, or layout.

An MDLL resembles a ring oscillator, in which the signal edge traveling along the delay line is periodically refreshed by a clean edge of the reference clock. In this manner, the phase noise of the ring oscillator is filtered up to half the reference frequency and the total output jitter is reduced significantly.

However, the most critical problem of ILCMs is that their jitter performance can degrade easily due to PVT. To ensure ultra-low jitter robustly, ILCMs must be equipped with background calibration that continuously adjusts the free-running frequency of the VCO, f VCO , to stay close to the target frequency, Nf REF , where N is the multiplication factor and f REF  is the frequency of S REF , thereby minimizing the frequency error.

Recently, many techniques have been presented to suppress those noise sources. The optimal-threshold TDC (OT TDC) [1] and the noise-shaping BBPD [2] are efficient techniques to reduce the quantization noise (Q-noise) of the TDC. The use of DTCs to cancel the Q-noise of the    has now become a general solution. To suppress the detrimental effects of the DTC nonlinearity, such as    Q-noise leakage, fractional spurs, and noise folding, linearization techniques also have been presented. Modulating the statistical property of the    code (e.g., probability-density-shaping  ()-  [3]) is another approach to avoid fractional spurs due to the DTC nonlinearity. Recently, the fractional- N  RO DPLL in [3] (at the top left of Fig. 23.2.1) achieved the rms jitter of less than 400fs by extending the loop bandwidth in addition to using the various techniques described above to reduce in-band noise. However, this level of rms jitter is still much higher than that of advanced  LC -PLLs. The graph of the in-band noise sources at the top right of Fig. 23.2.1 shows that, to further decrease the rms jitter, the next challenge is to reduce the thermal noise of the DTC, which increases in proportion to its required range [4]. Spending more power on the DTC might be an easy solution, but it degrades the overall FoM jitter  of the DPLL. Thus, more advanced and efficient solutions are needed.","title":"A 188fsrms-Jitter and 243d8-FoMjitter 5.2GHz-Ring-DCO-Based Fractional-N Digital PLL with a 1\/8 DTC-Range-Reduction Technique Using a Quadruple-Timing-Margin Phase Selector"}},{"docId":"156","weight":0.31239364262264874,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"High-speed transceivers embedded inside FPGAs require software-programmable clocking circuits to cover a wide range of data rates across different channels [1]. These transceivers use high-frequency PLLs with LC oscillators to satisfy stringent jitter requirements at increasing data rates. However, the large area of these oscillators limits the number of independent LC-based clocking sources and reduces the flexibility offered by the FPGA. A ring-based PLL occupies smaller area but produces higher jitter. With injection-locking (IL) techniques [2-3], ring-based oscillators achieve comparable performance with their LC counterparts [4-5] at frequencies below 10GHz. Moreover, addition of a PLL to an injection-locked VCO (IL-PLL) provides injection-timing calibration and frequency tracking against PVT [3,5]. Nevertheless, applying injection-locking techniques to high-speed ring oscillators in deep submicron CMOS processes, with high flicker-noise corner frequencies at tens of MHz, poses a design challenge for low-jitter operation. Shown in Fig. 2.8.1, injection locking can be modeled as a single-pole feedback system that achieves 20dB\/dec of in-band noise shaping against intrinsic VCO phase noise over a wide bandwidth [6]. As a consequence, this technique suppresses the 1\/f 2  noise of the VCO but not its 1\/f 3  noise. Note that the conventional IL-PLL is capable of shaping the VCO in-band noise at 40dB\/dec [6]; however, its noise shaping is limited by the narrow PLL bandwidth due to significant attenuation of the loop gain by injection locking.

However, there are still many challenges to overcome before these bands can be put to practical use. One of the most critical challenges is the design of a frequency synthesizer to generate sub-THz local-oscillator (LO) signals with extremely low jitter. This is because the value of the rms jitter required to support the target EVM decreases as the LO frequency increases, e.g., the rms jitter of an LO signal at 100GHz must be reduced to less than 50fs to satisfy 30dB EVM for 64-QAM. To achieve such low rms jitter, the bandwidth of a PLL must be extended to suppress the poor phase noise (PN) of a sub-THz VCO, but it cannot sufficiently filter the high in-band PN that is amplified by a large multiplication factor  (M) . Thus, to date, cascaded PLLs with frequency multipliers (FMs) [1], [2] have been used extensively since they can solve this dilemma. However, their multi-stage architectures require large power and silicon area. As a single-stage solution, sub-sampling PLLs (SSPLLs) are more efficient in terms of power and area. Since the high phase-error  (_) -detection gain  (K_)  of the sub-sampling PD (SSPD) can reduce the in-band PN dramatically, SSPLLs can have an extended bandwidth. However, the problem is that this merit of SSPLLs is no longer valid when the frequency of the VCO,  f_ , is increased much higher than the frequency of the output pole of the SSPD,  f_ . The top of Fig. 4.6.1 shows this situation, in which the value of  K_  is reduced significantly as the  _  is suppressed by the pole of the SSPD. Recently, the power-gating injection-locked-FM PD (PG-ILFM PD) was presented to address this  K_ -reduction problem of the SSPD at sub-THz frequencies [3]. First, it generates a discontinuous but ultra-low-jitter signal,  S_ , at the exact target frequency,  M f_REF , using a replica VCO (R-VCO).

For this reason, continuously tuning the free-running oscillation frequency, F OSC , to nullify the frequency error, F ERR , is required.

The first challenge is the ever-expanding range of FR1 (top of Fig. 4.2.1). In recent standards, FR1 is defined to cover the new-radio (NR) bands up to 7.1 GHz while still including sub-GHz existing bands. Second, LO generators should achieve very low IPN (integrated phase noise (PN)) to support high-order QAMs. To achieve IPN below -43dBc for 256-QAM, the rms jitter should be below 200fs in the upper-frequency bands. Third, LO signals should have accurate quadrature phases. To generate accurate quadrature LO signals with low IPN over the wide FR1 range, cascaded architectures are most popular (bottom left of Fig. 4.2.1). At the 1st stage, a fractional-N Pll with LC-VCOs generates low-jitter signals at relatively low frequencies. Then, frequency multipliers (FMs) increase these frequencies to higher bands.

Modern systems-on-chip (SoCs) require many such PLLs that cater to multi-core processors, memories, IO interfaces and power management. A ring-oscillator-based analog charge-pump PLL offers a flexible and power-efficient way to implement such clock multipliers. However, frequency compensation of analog PLLs requires a large loop filter capacitor that occupies significant area. The area penalty is further exacerbated in deep sub-micron CMOS processes due to increasing oscillator gain and gate leakage. For example, a 2GHz PLL in 65nm CMOS requires a 90pF capacitor (R=1k) to achieve 10MHz bandwidth and 70 phase margin. Assuming a capacitor density of 1fF\/m 2 , a 90pF capacitor occupies an area of 0.09mm 2 . Digital PLLs (DPLLs) offer an attractive means to eliminate the loop-filter capacitor [1, 2]. However, quantization error added by its loop components degrades the performance in multiple ways. First, it makes the DPLL loop inherently non-linear causing the steady state to be a bounded limit cycle, which manifests as deterministic jitter (DJ) at the PLL output. Second, it introduces conflicting noise bandwidth requirements, which makes it difficult to achieve low jitter in a power efficient manner. For instance, suppressing TDC quantization error by reducing PLL bandwidth increases the DCO phase noise contribution. As a result, DCO power must be increased to lower its noise contribution. This is especially problematic in ring-oscillator-based DPLLs. Finally, a high-resolution digital-to-analog converter (DAC) needed to interface the DLF output to the ring oscillator typically occupies large area and negates some of the area benefits of DPLLs [1, 2]. In view of these drawbacks, we present a PLL architecture that combines the advantages of analog (no quantization error) and digital PLLs (small area and scalability) by using a time-based integral path.

However, they suffer from quantization noise and spurs, requiring complex calibration techniques. Therefore, type-I reference-sampling PLLs are gaining popularity [3, 4] to achieve wider bandwidths in smaller areas. A passive sampling phase detector (SPD) has a much lower noise contribution than a charge pump. But, a fractional-N implementation requires a digital-to-time converter (DTC) to align the input clocks of the SPD for spur mitigation [3]. Precise gain and nonlinearity calibrations are needed as the DTC delay can vary significantly with process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations. This increases the complexity and loop convergence time, which are not preferable for IoT applications. A capacitive digital-to-analog-converter (CDAC)-based approach proposed in [4] relies on an accurate voltage reference provided externally, which also requires a calibration across PVT in practical implementations. This work presents a voltage-interpolation (VI) technique based on the capacitor charge sharing in a type-I sampling PLL to achieve the fractional-N operation and, therefore, eliminate a DTC or voltage reference and the associated complex calibration logic, providing fast phase locking. Furthermore, noise is minimized using a passive switch-capacitor-based VI (SC-VI), and the fractional frequency-synthesis resolution is enhanced utilizing a AZ-VI. Moreover, for edge-compute platforms, fast shutdown and restart of the clocking subsystem are necessary for efficient power management by transitioning among different power states. To enable such a requirement, the PLL is reconfigured to inject energy into the crystal for quick startup. Prior energy injection techniques in crystal oscillators for fast startup [5] used a dedicated ring voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), which exhibited startup time uncertainty due to high jitter and frequency drift across PVT, requiring an additional frequency calibration step. In contrast, reusing the LC VCO inside a PLL that follows the crystal oscillator to perform frequency synthesis introduces less noise and frequency drift for robust startup while eliminating the VCO frequency calibration step. In addition, the chirp mechanism, which is similar to [5], sets the VCO frequency very close to the desired steady-state value, providing faster PLL locking.","title":"A 2-to-2.48GHz Voltage-Interpolator-Based Fractional-N Type-I Sampling PLL in 22nm FinFET Assisting Fast Crystal Startup"}},{"docId":"296","weight":0.22101153706839125,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"High-performance, flexible clock synthesis is a key challenge in multiple applications, from high-data-rate I\/O to reconfigurable radio and radar. Conventional wireline and wireless LC-VCO based PLLs can cover a large tuning range using multiple frequency bands [1, 2], typically using a calibration loop to select an operating band for the VCO, then allowing the PLL to lock within that band. In effect, the in-band frequency tuning range of a typical high-performance LC-VCO covers a small fraction of the total range, the remainder of which is covered using switched high-Q fixed capacitors. This approach has been favored first due to the typically inferior quality factor of analog varactors as compared to that of high-Q vertical natural capacitors (VNCs) with CMOS switches, and second due to the unacceptable noise sensitivity of the VCO control node if the tuning range is covered using a single high-gain varactor. This traditional banding strategy leads to a number of practical problems. First, the entire VCO frequency range cannot be traversed while maintaining glitch-free phase lock, as changing bands involves simultaneously switching in and out large capacitors. Further, the per-band tuning range must be wide enough to guarantee that mismatch between digitally switched capacitor banks does not result in holes in the frequency transfer curve of the VCO. Finally, sufficient tuning range to accommodate temperature-and supply variation-induced drift must be present within each selected band, placing stringent demands on adjacent band overlap and on band selection algorithms.

As a result, dynamic thermal management (DTM) using a number of temperature sensors is essential. For accurate temperature measurement, the sensors should be placed close to heat sources. For this reason, although the main sensor is located outside the CPU, the sensing part is directly inserted into the logic in the form of remote probes, as shown in Fig. 13.6.1 [1]. However, the remote probe, which is composed of BJT or resistor, needs physical distance from the logic for improving gate-area uniformity and signal routing to the main sensor. In addition, the DTM period is inevitably long due to the time multiplexing and the requirement of setup time for analog blocks. Therefore, it is necessary to make the main sensor synthesizable and compact so that it can be inserted into the logic. However, BJT-based temperature sensors are not compatible with sub-1V supplies because of the base-emitter voltage of BJTs. It is also hard to design resistor-based temperature sensors in advanced processes since the resistors have been developed towards a zero temperature coefficient ratio (TCR). On the other hand, ring-oscillator-based temperature sensors composed of only transistors are suitable for integration into logic [2]. However, these sensors are sensitive to PVT variations and have leakage problems at high temperatures, so the sensing range is limited. This paper presents a fully synthesizable digital temperature sensor in 5nm FinFET CMOS. Since the sensor is based on wire metal as a proportional-to-absolute-temperature (PTAT) device, it can be integrated into hot-spot logic and is compatible with technology processes.

The situation is even more cumbersome employing a singlebit TDC, often referred to as bang-bang phase detector (BBPD), where the linearized gain is inversely proportional to the input jitter [1]. An accurate and repeatable value of the PLL bandwidth, and in the general of the frequency response, is essential to meet several specifications, such as stability margin, settling time, jitter and spur level. When the PLL is operated as a direct frequency modulator with pre-emphasis of the modulation signal, the accuracy requirement of the frequency response is even more demanding [2].

To minimize the bitcell area of the high-density SRAM bitcell, the number of fins (setting the channel width, W) of the pull-up PMOS (PU), passgate NMOS (PG) and pull-down NMOS (PD) transistors must be selected as 1:1:1. Since PU, PG, and PD have the same channel length (L), the ratio in geometry between the PU transistor and the PG transistor is equal to one. With the process variations, the strength of PU transistor can be much stronger than the PG transistor. A stronger PU transistor increases read stability of the SRAM bitcell but it degrades the write margin significantly and results in worse write-V DDMIN  issue. Figure 13.5.1(a) shows a contention condition between PU and PG transistors of a 6T-SRAM bitcell for the write operation. During the write operation, the PU transistor impedes the ability of the PG transistor to pull the storage node (S) from V DD  to ground. The bitcell may suffer a write failure at the stronger PU with weaker PG condition caused by the device variations. Two techniques have been proposed to improve the high density SRAM bitcell write V DDMIN : 1) negative bit-line voltage (NBL) to increase the strength of PG transistor and 2) lower cell V DD  (LCV) to weaken PU transistor strength [1-5].

Ideally, the TR should be in excess of one octave, since this allows the easy synthesis of all frequencies below those directly generated by the VCOs via repeated frequency divisions by 2.

This is a crucial requirement in modern radios, where there are more PLLs active at the same time, and particularly when (non-contiguous) carrier aggregation is implemented, since in this case the signal bands may be very close to each other. If an individual PLL is used for each band, the VCOs may oscillate very close to each other, or at frequencies that are harmonically related to each other, posing a very serious issue of mutual pulling through the respective magnetic field.

SNR at low-light conditions, which is a key performance metric, is determined by the sensitivity and crosstalk in pixels. To improve sensitivity, pixel technology has migrated from frontside illumination (FSI) to backside illumiation (BSI) as pixel size shrinks down. In BSI technology, it is very difficult to further increase the sensitivity in a pixel of near-1.0m size because there are no structural obstacles for incident light from micro-lens to photodiode. Therefore the only way to improve low-light SNR is to reduce crosstalk, which makes the non-diagonal elements of the color-correction matrix (CCM) close to zero and thus reduces color noise [3]. The best way to improve crosstalk is to introduce a complete physical isolation between neighboring pixels, e.g., using deep-trench isolation (DTI). So far, a few attempts using DTI have been made to suppress silicon crosstalk. A backside DTI in as small as 1.12m-pixel, which is formed in the BSI process, is reported in [4], but it is just an intermediate step in the DTI-related technology because it cannot completely prevent silicon crosstalk, especially for long wavelengths of light. On the other hand, front-side DTIs for FSI pixels [5] and BSI pixels [6] are reported. In [5], however, DTI is present not only along the periphery of each pixel, but also invades into the pixel so that it is inefficient in terms of gathering incident light and providing sufficient amount of photodiode area. In [6], the pixel size is as large as 2.0m and it is hard to scale down with this technology for near 1.0m pitch because DTI width imposes a critical limit on the sufficient amount of photodiode area for full-well capacity. Thus, a new technological advance is necessary to realize the ideal front DTI in a small size pixel near 1.0m.","title":"7.1 A 1\/4-inch 8Mpixel CMOS image sensor with 3D backside-illuminated 1.12m pixel with front-side deep-trench isolation and vertical transfer gate"}},{"docId":"61","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Despite versatility and low power consumption, direct-conversion transmitters suffer from a fundamental drawback: the local oscillator disturbance by the power amplifier, through unwanted electromagnetic or capacitive coupling [1,2].

However, current active matrix OLED (AMOLED) displays on foil do not validate this power-efficient advantage, as too much power is lost in the AM backplane. AMOLED displays use the analog voltage on the gate of a drive transistor (e.g. M1 in Fig. 30.2.1) to control the pixel current and hence the pixel brightness. Accurate and uniform pixel currents can only be obtained when transistor M1 is driven is saturation. In highresolution technologies on foil, transistor parameters W, L and the mobility  are limited by technology, imposing a minimal V GS -V T  to obtain sufficient current, i.e. V GS -V T  > 4V for a-IGZO on foil [1]. Subsequently, to obtain saturation, V DS  > 4V, which translates in a static backplane power loss surpassing the OLED power consumption (see red stars in Fig 30.2.1). However, when the OLED pixel impedance around a specific reference current can be matched along a display column line, the accurate pixel current control can be imposed by current DACs implemented in external silicon display column drivers. In this work, we operate M1 as a switch and pixel intensity variations are obtained using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) of a predefined pixel current, i.e. 2A\/pixel [8080m 2 ] (which corresponds in our OLED technology to a light output of 2000Cd\/m 2 ). When, in a future implementation the external DACs are calibrated at 0.2A\/pixel, the full brightness would correspond to the typical display brightness of a portable PC, i.e. 200Cd\/m 2 . This concept enables us to reduce the display power voltage at full brightness from 8.2V in a classical AMOLED display on foil configuration to 5V (measured) and for future implementations even down to 4V (see Fig. 30.2.1).

Each of the 10 transceiver channels interfaces with a MEMS transducer, and each includes a transmitter and a readout circuit. Echoes from off-axis targets arrive with different phase shifts for each element in the array.

A 60GHz wireless communication single-chip transceiver has not yet been reported due to large power consumption issues.

A 2GHz broadband OFDM single-chip transceiver suffers from SNR degradation due to the reference clock (REFCLK) and baseband clock (BBCLK) spurs in RF\/analog circuits. Low frequency spurs in the clock generator (CLKPLL) due to the mixing of the ADC\/DAC sampling clock (SCLK) and other clocks such as REFCLK and BBCLK have been eliminated by careful frequency planning of those clocks. In addition to that, spur suppression in digital baseband and noise-tolerant RF\/analog circuit designs are employed. The spurs have been successfully suppressed to less than 35dBc. The chip achieves a PHY data-rate of 2.35Gb\/s and MAC throughput of 2.0Gb\/s at a distance of 4cm. Power consumption is scalable to the throughput by the introduction of fast Sleep and Awake modes.

Ideally, the TR should be in excess of one octave, since this allows the easy synthesis of all frequencies below those directly generated by the VCOs via repeated frequency divisions by 2.

SNR at low-light conditions, which is a key performance metric, is determined by the sensitivity and crosstalk in pixels. To improve sensitivity, pixel technology has migrated from frontside illumination (FSI) to backside illumiation (BSI) as pixel size shrinks down. In BSI technology, it is very difficult to further increase the sensitivity in a pixel of near-1.0m size because there are no structural obstacles for incident light from micro-lens to photodiode. Therefore the only way to improve low-light SNR is to reduce crosstalk, which makes the non-diagonal elements of the color-correction matrix (CCM) close to zero and thus reduces color noise [3]. The best way to improve crosstalk is to introduce a complete physical isolation between neighboring pixels, e.g., using deep-trench isolation (DTI). So far, a few attempts using DTI have been made to suppress silicon crosstalk. A backside DTI in as small as 1.12m-pixel, which is formed in the BSI process, is reported in [4], but it is just an intermediate step in the DTI-related technology because it cannot completely prevent silicon crosstalk, especially for long wavelengths of light. On the other hand, front-side DTIs for FSI pixels [5] and BSI pixels [6] are reported. In [5], however, DTI is present not only along the periphery of each pixel, but also invades into the pixel so that it is inefficient in terms of gathering incident light and providing sufficient amount of photodiode area. In [6], the pixel size is as large as 2.0m and it is hard to scale down with this technology for near 1.0m pitch because DTI width imposes a critical limit on the sufficient amount of photodiode area for full-well capacity. Thus, a new technological advance is necessary to realize the ideal front DTI in a small size pixel near 1.0m.","title":"7.1 A 1\/4-inch 8Mpixel CMOS image sensor with 3D backside-illuminated 1.12m pixel with front-side deep-trench isolation and vertical transfer gate"}},{"docId":"61","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Despite versatility and low power consumption, direct-conversion transmitters suffer from a fundamental drawback: the local oscillator disturbance by the power amplifier, through unwanted electromagnetic or capacitive coupling [1,2].

However, current active matrix OLED (AMOLED) displays on foil do not validate this power-efficient advantage, as too much power is lost in the AM backplane. AMOLED displays use the analog voltage on the gate of a drive transistor (e.g. M1 in Fig. 30.2.1) to control the pixel current and hence the pixel brightness. Accurate and uniform pixel currents can only be obtained when transistor M1 is driven is saturation. In highresolution technologies on foil, transistor parameters W, L and the mobility  are limited by technology, imposing a minimal V GS -V T  to obtain sufficient current, i.e. V GS -V T  > 4V for a-IGZO on foil [1]. Subsequently, to obtain saturation, V DS  > 4V, which translates in a static backplane power loss surpassing the OLED power consumption (see red stars in Fig 30.2.1). However, when the OLED pixel impedance around a specific reference current can be matched along a display column line, the accurate pixel current control can be imposed by current DACs implemented in external silicon display column drivers. In this work, we operate M1 as a switch and pixel intensity variations are obtained using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) of a predefined pixel current, i.e. 2A\/pixel [8080m 2 ] (which corresponds in our OLED technology to a light output of 2000Cd\/m 2 ). When, in a future implementation the external DACs are calibrated at 0.2A\/pixel, the full brightness would correspond to the typical display brightness of a portable PC, i.e. 200Cd\/m 2 . This concept enables us to reduce the display power voltage at full brightness from 8.2V in a classical AMOLED display on foil configuration to 5V (measured) and for future implementations even down to 4V (see Fig. 30.2.1). As the OLED current load remains equal, a corresponding static power reduction of the display (and increased battery lifetime) is obtained. Digital driving methods of AMOLED displays have been shown before. However,  techniques [2] still integrate charge packets on the gate of M1 and hence do not solve the power issue on foil. Other PWM techniques [3] activate only a single active line in the linedriver yielding difficulties to obtain color depths above 6 bits. When multiple independent linedrivers are implemented and their output is multiplexed to alternately drive a single select line, a higher color depth can be obtained [4]. This leads however to a bulky linedriver, which is hard to get within an e.g. 80m pitch. The design and implementation of a compact integrated linedriver on foil enabling multiple alternating active signals through a single shift register is demonstrated here.","title":"30.2 Digital PWM-driven AMOLED display on flex reducing static power consumption"}},{"docId":"70","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"This paper presents a 576b LDPC decoder test-chip designed using a charge-recovery logic family.

However, the cross-regulation and power consumption are two main issues of the previously reported SIMO converters [1-5]. Although pseudo-continuous conduction-mode (PCCM) control with a freewheel period [1] tries to augment power density and eliminate cross-regulation, associated power dissipation of freewheel switch exacerbates its overall efficiency.

The comparator-based controlled SIMO converters are investigated in [3, 4] and the cross-regulation in most channels is improved due to the fast response of the comparator. However, since the channel that is last connected to inductor is inevitably regulated by the accumulative error of all channels to balance the overall inductor current, every load transition at other outputs will introduce serious cross-regulation [3] and load-regulation problem [4] in the channel.

While EEG is an established method for non-invasive electrical activity, electrical-impedance tomography (EIT) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can additionally measure impedance changes and hemodynamic processes. To facilitate long-term multi-channel brain imaging in a wearable form factor without cabling overhead, there is a need for low-power local amplifiers [1] to support all these modalities. The main principle of optical hemodynamic measurements is to send light pulses into the tissue and measure the reflected light, which is modulated by the oxygen levels in the blood (Fig. 17.8.1). State-of-the-art NIRS ICs typically consume a few mW, primarily for the LEDs to meet the required light sensitivity at the photodiodes (PDs). Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are promising alternatives because they have excellent low-light detection capabilities, speed of response and higher detection efficiency in both visible and near infrared range [2]. Hence, SiPMs allow deeper brain sensing depth and the possibility to sample consistent cerebral regions with larger inter-optode distance. This benefit would significantly reduce the number of NIRS channels and the associated power for a wearable NIRS device. Although SiPMs require a higher bias voltage (30V) than PDs, they achieve similar NIRS responses with a few hundred times less LED current. This results in a low-power NIRS ASIC and an overall power-efficient system. Existing optical sensing ICs are not suitable for a SiPM because of its large and variable output current. Trimming-based calibration methods [3] suffer from drift over time. Auto-zeroing by swapping an integrator capacitor [4][5] compensates ambient light at the cost of the integrator's headroom. Apart from ambient light, the dynamic range (DR) of the amplifier is also limited by a large NIRS signal, leading to a power-hungry readout.","title":"A 665W silicon photomultiplier-based NIRS\/EEG\/EIT monitoring asic for wearable functional brain imaging"}},{"docId":"817","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Wearable ExG biopotential acquisition systems can potentially capture a wealth of clinically useful diagnostic information during activities of daily life.

In addition, the wires that connect each electrode to an array of high-impedance AFEs can easily pick up interference and large, potentially saturating artifacts.

First, conventional BioZ interfaces typically rely on gel electrodes (> 10cm 2 ) for low-impedance contact between skin and electrodes [1][2]. This not only hampers the long-term recording but also causes user discomfort. However, it is very challenging to perform small-size dry-electrode BioZ sensing at the frequency range of 1kHz to 1MHz, where both the increased electrode-tissue impedance (ETI) (-10MII0.5nF) and input parasitic capacitance  C_p(> 10pF)  play a dominating role in attenuating the input signal (Fig. 20.1.1), resulting in gain inaccuracy and a long settling time [3].

One compelling sensing modality for wearable sensors is cumulative light exposure. For instance, reduced light exposure exacerbates depression, while high levels of sunlight exposure are well known as the primary cause of skin cancer. In order for wearable sensors to determine how much light radiation the skin is receiving, a light-to-digital converter (LDC) is needed to both measure instantaneous light intensity and record the total accumulated light energy. LDCs targeting wearable devices will have tight constraints on area (cost) and power. At the same time, the wide dynamic range of light (10 6 ) from 0.1lx to 100klx places difficult performance requirements on the LDC. Previous LDCs integrate photodiode current and use a transimpedance amplifier followed by ADC conversion [1-2], resulting in continuous power consumption up to 100s of W, which is not sustainable for wearable devices with small batteries. Recently, a low-power LDC based on logarithmic digital-to-resistance conversion was proposed for heart rate monitoring [3], but its input dynamic range is too small for light energy monitoring. An alternate approach converts light intensity to frequency [4], which is then measured with a frequency-to-digital converter. However, this approach consumes significant power at strong light levels as oscillation frequency increases linearly with light intensity. Also, this approach requires an accurate reference timer circuit that may not be available during sleep\/standby modes common in wearable devices.","title":"4.4 A sub-nW 80mlx-to-1.26Mlx self-referencing light-to-digital converter with AlGaAs photodiode"}},{"docId":"482","weight":0.6291494275230045,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Epidural spinal stimulation has shown effectiveness in recovering the motor function of spinal cord transected rats by modulating neural networks in lumbosacral spinal segments [1, 2].

CMI degrades the signal quality in two ways. First, it appears as a differential-mode signal together with the ECG, because of common-mode to differential-mode (CM-DM) conversion. This is often due to the electrode impedance mismatch [1], as contacts inevitably lose their properties differently during long-term recording. Second, CMI that exceeds the supply voltage saturates the amplifier and distorts the recording when the subject is near power lines [4]. To address both of these issues, the recoding IC must withstand large CMI and also have a large total-CMRR (T-CMRR) that includes the effect of electrode mismatch. Unfortunately, prior works provide solutions to only one of them, and thus there is a lack of reliable long-term ECG recording in a practical setting. In [2, 3], CM-DM conversion is addressed by increasing the input impedance in common-mode. However, the IA fails when there is large CMI. In addition, one of the main issues of the input impedance boosting method is that chopping, despite its benefit in 1\/f noise reduction, cannot be used, as it reduces the input impedance. Hence, a CM-DM suppression technique that is effective for low input impedance IA is desired. In [4, 5], tolerance to CMI is improved by absorbing the CMI current. However, their T-CMRRs are poor (65 dB). In this work, we propose a CMI-tolerant amplifier with an adaptive CMI-canceling technique. It ensures 100 dB of T-CMRR when there is an electrode mismatch of 152k  and CMI of 15V, even when the input capacitance is as large as 120pF.","title":"28.6 A 22.6 W Biopotential Amplifier with Adaptive Common-Mode Interference Cancelation Achieving Total-CMRR of 104dB and CMI Tolerance of 15Vpp in 0.18m CMOS"}},{"docId":"221","weight":0.533496679647376,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Approximately 1 in 8 U.S. women will develop breast cancer over the course of her lifetime, and breast cancer death rates are higher than those for any other cancer, besides lung cancer.

Instead, time-domain quantization through VCO-based AFEs benefits from scaled CMOS and offers intrinsic 1st-order noise shaping. However, the non-linear V-F conversion of conventional VCO-based AFEs makes achieving a large and linear DR difficult [1]. To address this, [3] adopts a differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) technique that enables the VCO to process only a small prediction error, VERR, by subtracting from VIN a digital predictor value fed through a DAC (Fig. 28.1.1 top). Maximal linearity would be achieved if the predictor was perfect, resulting in V ERR   0; however, this requires a high-performance and power-expensive DAC. Therefore, [3] truncates the predictor's output, reducing the DAC requirements to 9b, but adding truncation error, ET. If the gain of paths P 1  and P 2  are made equal, which is enforced in [3] via a gain error calibration (GEC) circuit, E T  will ideally cancel at the output.

However, real-time imaging and navigation during high precision surgery necessitates the use of X-Ray fluoroscopy with most existing technologies to achieve precise localization. Intramedullary (IM) nailing is a common example of such high precision orthopedic surgery, which requires insertion of a nail into the medullary canal of a fractured bone followed by locking screws [1]. Proximal screw locking is performed using a mechanical guide, which is not possible for distal locking owing to the deformation (15mm) caused during insertion [2]. Freehand technique is typically used to localize distal holes, in which the surgical drill is aligned with the hole axis through fluoroscopic imaging. This process is time-consuming and exposes the patient and surgical team to high ionizing radiation. Various other methods, which reduce or eliminate irradiation during distal locking, are not widely used. This is attributed to their lack of compensation for significant deformation of the nail, added requirements such as computing systems, extra robotic arms, CT images, sophisticated hardware and software that require training for the surgeon and staff. This paper presents a navigation system for 3D localization using magnetic field gradients, which is inspired by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) but does not require the strong magnetic field used in MRI [3], and can replace fluoroscopy during IM nailing. The goal is to generate monotonically varying magnetic fields in the desired Field-of-View (FOV) such that each spatial point corresponds to a unique field value. The field is sensed by miniaturized devices in the FOV and communicated wirelessly to a receiver, which maps the field to spatial coordinates and displays the device location in real-time. Monotonically varying magnetic fields are generated using low-cost planar electromagnet coils, placed beneath the patient's leg. A battery-less wireless device capable of measuring and transmitting the value of its local magnetic field, is attached to the distal end of the implanted nail. This device consists of a 3D magnetic sensor (AK09970N), a CMOS chip to interface with the sensor, an off-chip coil for wireless power transfer (WPT) and data communication, and off-chip capacitors for energy storage. Another similar device is installed in the surgical drill. In the measurement phase, both devices measure magnetic fields in X, Y and Z at their respective locations. A computing system decodes the spatial position of both the devices from the received magnetic field data and displays their relative locations on a monitor, which helps the surgeon to maneuver to the hole location in real-time. The resolution of magnetic field measured by the devices (AB) and strength of the applied magnetic field gradient (G), together set the localization resolution (LR) of the system as LR = AB\/G.","title":"20.4 3D Surgical Alignment with 100m Resolution Using Magnetic-Field Gradient-Based Localization"}},{"docId":"1103","weight":0.11161781464182212,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"A battery-powered miniature ultrasound (US) imaging system implemented in the form of an endoscopy capsule is a promising diagnostic device [1].

Currently, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) with carbon microfiber (CMF) electrodes is the method of choice in neuroscience labs for monitoring the concentration of phasic (transient) DA release. This method offers sub-second temporal resolution and high specificity because the signal of interest occurs at a known potential. However, existing CMF electrodes are bulky, limiting the spatial resolution to single-site measurements. Further, they are produced through manual processes (e.g. cutting CMFs under optical microscope), thus introducing significant device variability [1]. Lastly, when long probes (3-to-5cm) are used to monitor DA release in deep brain structures of large animals, environmental noise severely diminishes the detection limit [1].

For each transducer element, such an ASIC contains a pulser that drives the element to generate a pressure wave, a low-noise amplifier (LNA) that amplifies the resulting echo signal, and a time-gain compensation (TGC) circuit that compensates for the time-varying echo-signal amplitude due to propagation attenuation of the acoustic wave. Without TGC, the first echoes, from shallow tissue, are much larger than later echoes from deeper tissue. The TGC circuit corrects for this, ideally by providing a gain that increases exponentially with time, thus reducing the dynamic range (DR) by as much as 40dB and strongly relaxing the requirements of subsequent blocks. In conventional ultrasound systems, TGC is typically performed after the LNA, implying that a power-hungry LNA is required that can handle the full DR of the echo signal [5], [6]. In recent in-probe ASICs, programmable-gain LNAs have been employed that provide a step-wise TGC approximation [1]-[3]. While this saves power, the associated gain-switching transients lead to imaging artefacts. In this paper, we present an LNA with a built-in continuous TGC function that mitigates this problem. The LNA is a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) optimized to amplify the signal current of a capacitive micro-machined ultrasound transducer (CMUT).

The evolution from 2D planar NAND to 3D NAND enables the development of high-density storage by increasing the number of stacked word-lines (WLs) in a smaller footprint. The industry has moved beyond 96-stacked-WL and achieved a 128-stacked 3D NAND. A 128-stacked 3b\/cell 3D NAND with a density of 7.8Gb\/mm  2  was reported recently, based on a peripheral circuit under cell array (PUC) structure [1]. Nevertheless, due to the constant demand for increased density, 3D NAND faces the following challenges [2,3]: (1) a reduced PUC area due to an increasing WL stack, (2) increased load due to a higher number of stacks and a reduced spacing between WLs, (3) rising WL-channel capacitance due to an increasing number of strings, and (4) variation in the RC delay between WLs due to the non-uniformity of plug critical dimension (CD). Not only do these problems limit the density improvement of 3D NAND, but they also increase the WL rise time, which degrades read and write performance. This paper proposes the following techniques to overcome these challenges: (1) a 12-stage page buffer (PB) with one-to-one (1:1) PBUS(PB to cache connection bus), (2) a variable stage and frequency charge pump with a boosted local pump, (3) center X-decoder (XDEC) and half-plane activation, (4) an unselected string boosting scheme, and (5) adaptive WL overdrive (OVD).

Even in digital PLLs, which rely on a digital loop filter, the bandwidth still depends on the gains of two mixed-signal building blocks, namely the time\/digital converter (TDC) and the digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO), that have conversion characteristics that are not well-controlled. The situation is even more cumbersome employing a singlebit TDC, often referred to as bang-bang phase detector (BBPD), where the linearized gain is inversely proportional to the input jitter [1]. An accurate and repeatable value of the PLL bandwidth, and in the general of the frequency response, is essential to meet several specifications, such as stability margin, settling time, jitter and spur level. When the PLL is operated as a direct frequency modulator with pre-emphasis of the modulation signal, the accuracy requirement of the frequency response is even more demanding [2]. Previously disclosed methods to control PLL bandwidth require a modulation signal to be injected into the loop [2], compensate the gain variations of just a single block (e.g., VCO [3] or BBPD [4]), or operate in the foreground [5]. This paper presents a digital PLL employing a digital background normalization of loop gain, which makes it independent of any analog variable (except for the reference frequency, which often is available from an accurate source).

To minimize the bitcell area of the high-density SRAM bitcell, the number of fins (setting the channel width, W) of the pull-up PMOS (PU), passgate NMOS (PG) and pull-down NMOS (PD) transistors must be selected as 1:1:1. Since PU, PG, and PD have the same channel length (L), the ratio in geometry between the PU transistor and the PG transistor is equal to one. With the process variations, the strength of PU transistor can be much stronger than the PG transistor. A stronger PU transistor increases read stability of the SRAM bitcell but it degrades the write margin significantly and results in worse write-V DDMIN  issue. Figure 13.5.1(a) shows a contention condition between PU and PG transistors of a 6T-SRAM bitcell for the write operation. During the write operation, the PU transistor impedes the ability of the PG transistor to pull the storage node (S) from V DD  to ground. The bitcell may suffer a write failure at the stronger PU with weaker PG condition caused by the device variations. Two techniques have been proposed to improve the high density SRAM bitcell write V DDMIN : 1) negative bit-line voltage (NBL) to increase the strength of PG transistor and 2) lower cell V DD  (LCV) to weaken PU transistor strength [1-5].

To improve the efficiency of power amplifiers (PA), the trend is towards Class-AB and Class-B PAs that exhibit better energy efficiency compared to Class-A.

This paper presents a 60GHz complementary Push-Pull PA, using both NMOS and PMOS transistors. An inverter-like architecture which uses both PMOS and NMOS results in the cancellation of AM-PM distortion which is particularly important in high-fidelity amplification of OFDM systems and high-order modulation schemes like 16- and 64-QAM, which are very sensitive to phase distortion.

Ideally, the TR should be in excess of one octave, since this allows the easy synthesis of all frequencies below those directly generated by the VCOs via repeated frequency divisions by 2.

SNR at low-light conditions, which is a key performance metric, is determined by the sensitivity and crosstalk in pixels. To improve sensitivity, pixel technology has migrated from frontside illumination (FSI) to backside illumiation (BSI) as pixel size shrinks down. In BSI technology, it is very difficult to further increase the sensitivity in a pixel of near-1.0m size because there are no structural obstacles for incident light from micro-lens to photodiode. Therefore the only way to improve low-light SNR is to reduce crosstalk, which makes the non-diagonal elements of the color-correction matrix (CCM) close to zero and thus reduces color noise [3]. The best way to improve crosstalk is to introduce a complete physical isolation between neighboring pixels, e.g., using deep-trench isolation (DTI). So far, a few attempts using DTI have been made to suppress silicon crosstalk. A backside DTI in as small as 1.12m-pixel, which is formed in the BSI process, is reported in [4], but it is just an intermediate step in the DTI-related technology because it cannot completely prevent silicon crosstalk, especially for long wavelengths of light. On the other hand, front-side DTIs for FSI pixels [5] and BSI pixels [6] are reported. In [5], however, DTI is present not only along the periphery of each pixel, but also invades into the pixel so that it is inefficient in terms of gathering incident light and providing sufficient amount of photodiode area. In [6], the pixel size is as large as 2.0m and it is hard to scale down with this technology for near 1.0m pitch because DTI width imposes a critical limit on the sufficient amount of photodiode area for full-well capacity. Thus, a new technological advance is necessary to realize the ideal front DTI in a small size pixel near 1.0m.","title":"7.1 A 1\/4-inch 8Mpixel CMOS image sensor with 3D backside-illuminated 1.12m pixel with front-side deep-trench isolation and vertical transfer gate"}},{"docId":"61","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Despite versatility and low power consumption, direct-conversion transmitters suffer from a fundamental drawback: the local oscillator disturbance by the power amplifier, through unwanted electromagnetic or capacitive coupling [1,2].

However, current active matrix OLED (AMOLED) displays on foil do not validate this power-efficient advantage, as too much power is lost in the AM backplane. AMOLED displays use the analog voltage on the gate of a drive transistor (e.g. M1 in Fig. 30.2.1) to control the pixel current and hence the pixel brightness. Accurate and uniform pixel currents can only be obtained when transistor M1 is driven is saturation. In highresolution technologies on foil, transistor parameters W, L and the mobility  are limited by technology, imposing a minimal V GS -V T  to obtain sufficient current, i.e. V GS -V T  > 4V for a-IGZO on foil [1]. Subsequently, to obtain saturation, V DS  > 4V, which translates in a static backplane power loss surpassing the OLED power consumption (see red stars in Fig 30.2.1). However, when the OLED pixel impedance around a specific reference current can be matched along a display column line, the accurate pixel current control can be imposed by current DACs implemented in external silicon display column drivers. In this work, we operate M1 as a switch and pixel intensity variations are obtained using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) of a predefined pixel current, i.e. 2A\/pixel [8080m 2 ] (which corresponds in our OLED technology to a light output of 2000Cd\/m 2 ). When, in a future implementation the external DACs are calibrated at 0.2A\/pixel, the full brightness would correspond to the typical display brightness of a portable PC, i.e. 200Cd\/m 2 . This concept enables us to reduce the display power voltage at full brightness from 8.2V in a classical AMOLED display on foil configuration to 5V (measured) and for future implementations even down to 4V (see Fig. 30.2.1). As the OLED current load remains equal, a corresponding static power reduction of the display (and increased battery lifetime) is obtained. Digital driving methods of AMOLED displays have been shown before. However,  techniques [2] still integrate charge packets on the gate of M1 and hence do not solve the power issue on foil.

ToF technology provides an accurate high pixel resolution, low motion blur, wide field of view (FoV), high dynamic range depth image as well as an ambient light invariant brightness image (active IR) that meets the highest quality requirements for 3D motion detection.","title":"7.6 A 512424 CMOS 3D Time-of-Flight image sensor with multi-frequency photo-demodulation up to 130MHz and 2GS\/s ADC"}}],"topWords":[{"weight":0.07478266227250631,"label":"nand"},{"weight":0.06224503153968682,"label":"flash"},{"weight":0.049424672258035166,"label":"cell"},{"weight":0.04330665317548053,"label":"nand flash"},{"weight":0.04256763276208049,"label":"3d"},{"weight":0.04025833155622747,"label":"memory"},{"weight":0.03943069734424555,"label":"flash memory"},{"weight":0.034273939876244,"label":"3d nand"},{"weight":0.03361735335438692,"label":"read"},{"weight":0.03239147278946359,"label":"layer"},{"weight":0.028944583863434962,"label":"density"},{"weight":0.02809409293943002,"label":"wl"},{"weight":0.02766048248835682,"label":"3b cell"},{"weight":0.027022282105971695,"label":"3b"},{"weight":0.025280461892298677,"label":"storage"},{"weight":0.022693265946536232,"label":"technology"},{"weight":0.020367488232335324,"label":"performance"},{"weight":0.019325330390436775,"label":"3d flash"},{"weight":0.017898076866573902,"label":"program"},{"weight":0.01724158172213563,"label":"bit"}],"topicIndex":17},{"topicId":"18","topDocs":[{"docId":"42","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"The next-generation enterprise Xeon   server processor has 15 dual-threaded 64b Ivybridge cores [1] and 37.5MB shared L3 cache.

The master processor executes scalar instruction packets and issues vector instruction packets to the slave coprocessor. The vector coprocessor executes wide-data arithmetic and memory operations for significant processing at the cost of high power. The power delivery for a mobile system-on-chip (SoC) processor consists of a battery that drives a PMIC to generate the SoC supply voltage (V DD ) rails. The PMIC voltage regulator (VR) supplies V DD  while operating below a peak-current specification (spec). If the CDSP exceeds the peak-current spec for a sustained duration, then the battery and\/or PMIC VR may incur a brownout condition where V DD  degrades, resulting in circuit failures. Thus, the CDSP requires a current-limiting system to prevent brownout. The latency requirement to detect the current exceeding the peak-current spec and then to respond by operating at a lower current is 1s. Also, the SoC must operate within a target thermal design power and temperature with detection and response latencies in 100's of s and 10's of ms, respectively. Prior current- and temperature-limiting systems lower the phase-locked loop (PLL) clock frequency (F CLK ) or reduce V DD  and (F CLK ) in response to exceeding current or temperature specs. Although these techniques are effective for response latencies above 10s, the time to reduce the PLL F CLk  or V DD  and F CLK  far exceeds the 10s latency spec. Alternative approaches for satisfying the 1s latency target include integrating an adaptive clocking circuit after the PLL [4] or throttling the instruction-issue rate [5] to quickly change performance. These designs satisfy the latency spec by globally reducing performance without considering individual thread power or priority. This paper describes a thread-level power management (TPM) design to adapt the instruction-issue rate based on individual thread power and priority for a current- and temperature-limiting system in a 7nm [6] Hexagon CDSP. The TPM exploits low-power phases during thread execution to adjust the thread instruction-issue rate to achieve a higher performance at a target power as compared to global throttling.","title":"35.3 Thread-Level Power Management for a Current- and Temperature-Limiting System in a 7nm Hexagon Processor"}},{"docId":"21","weight":0.14677230565564453,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"The demand for high-performance graphics capability even in extremely power-constrained platforms such as smartphones and tablets requires circuit techniques that scale from efficient operation at low voltage to high performance when needed.

Even in digital PLLs, which rely on a digital loop filter, the bandwidth still depends on the gains of two mixed-signal building blocks, namely the time\/digital converter (TDC) and the digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO), that have conversion characteristics that are not well-controlled. The situation is even more cumbersome employing a singlebit TDC, often referred to as bang-bang phase detector (BBPD), where the linearized gain is inversely proportional to the input jitter [1]. An accurate and repeatable value of the PLL bandwidth, and in the general of the frequency response, is essential to meet several specifications, such as stability margin, settling time, jitter and spur level. When the PLL is operated as a direct frequency modulator with pre-emphasis of the modulation signal, the accuracy requirement of the frequency response is even more demanding [2]. Previously disclosed methods to control PLL bandwidth require a modulation signal to be injected into the loop [2], compensate the gain variations of just a single block (e.g., VCO [3] or BBPD [4]), or operate in the foreground [5]. This paper presents a digital PLL employing a digital background normalization of loop gain, which makes it independent of any analog variable (except for the reference frequency, which often is available from an accurate source).

Therefore, it is expected to achieve better performance with lower SRAM V DDMIN . However, the quantized sizing of the channel width and length has drawbacks for conventional 6T-SRAM bitcell scaling. To minimize the bitcell area of the high-density SRAM bitcell, the number of fins (setting the channel width, W) of the pull-up PMOS (PU), passgate NMOS (PG) and pull-down NMOS (PD) transistors must be selected as 1:1:1. Since PU, PG, and PD have the same channel length (L), the ratio in geometry between the PU transistor and the PG transistor is equal to one. With the process variations, the strength of PU transistor can be much stronger than the PG transistor. A stronger PU transistor increases read stability of the SRAM bitcell but it degrades the write margin significantly and results in worse write-V DDMIN  issue. Figure 13.5.1(a) shows a contention condition between PU and PG transistors of a 6T-SRAM bitcell for the write operation. During the write operation, the PU transistor impedes the ability of the PG transistor to pull the storage node (S) from V DD  to ground. The bitcell may suffer a write failure at the stronger PU with weaker PG condition caused by the device variations. Two techniques have been proposed to improve the high density SRAM bitcell write V DDMIN : 1) negative bit-line voltage (NBL) to increase the strength of PG transistor and 2) lower cell V DD  (LCV) to weaken PU transistor strength [1-5].

However, Class-AB and -B biasing brings along large amplitude-to-phase-modulation (AM-PM) distortion which degrades EVM and ACPR. At the same time, PMOS transistors become attractive in nanometer CMOS as their f MAX  exceeds 140GHz. This makes it possible to use both NMOS and PMOS transistors at mm-Wave frequencies. This paper presents a 60GHz complementary Push-Pull PA, using both NMOS and PMOS transistors. An inverter-like architecture which uses both PMOS and NMOS results in the cancellation of AM-PM distortion which is particularly important in high-fidelity amplification of OFDM systems and high-order modulation schemes like 16- and 64-QAM, which are very sensitive to phase distortion. Furthermore, the complementary nature allows deep Class-AB operation, giving a high power efficiency at power back-off comparable to state-of-the-art 60GHz PA structures based on NMOS only.","title":"14.3 A Push-Pull mm-Wave power amplifier with <0.8 AM-PM distortion in 40nm CMOS"}},{"docId":"46","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"An FPGA employing c-axis aligned crystal In-Ga-Zn oxide (CAAC-IGZO) FET [1] based configuration memories (CMs) is known to need no reconfiguration thanks to nonvolatile CMs, shows high operation speed due to boosting effect of pass gates used in routing switches (RS) [2], and easily realizes fine-grained multi-context (FG-MC) architecture [2] because CMs which need very low power to keep the contents can be constructed with a small number of transistors.

Ideally, the TR should be in excess of one octave, since this allows the easy synthesis of all frequencies below those directly generated by the VCOs via repeated frequency divisions by 2. At the same time, the oscillation spectrum should be affected as little as possible by spurious (common-mode) magnetic fields impinging on the inductor coil in the VCO tank. This is a crucial requirement in modern radios, where there are more PLLs active at the same time, and particularly when (non-contiguous) carrier aggregation is implemented, since in this case the signal bands may be very close to each other. If an individual PLL is used for each band, the VCOs may oscillate very close to each other, or at frequencies that are harmonically related to each other, posing a very serious issue of mutual pulling through the respective magnetic field. And even if a single VCO is used [2], or two (or more) VCOs that are not harmonically related [3], it is nevertheless a good practice to design the tank inductor as insensitive as possible to external magnetic fields, which abound in and close to the radio IC.","title":"21.6 A 2.4-to-5.3GHz dual-core CMOS VCO with concentric 8-shaped coils"}},{"docId":"56","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Since the invention of radio, superheterodyne has been the architecture of choice for receivers (RX).

SNR at low-light conditions, which is a key performance metric, is determined by the sensitivity and crosstalk in pixels. To improve sensitivity, pixel technology has migrated from frontside illumination (FSI) to backside illumiation (BSI) as pixel size shrinks down. In BSI technology, it is very difficult to further increase the sensitivity in a pixel of near-1.0m size because there are no structural obstacles for incident light from micro-lens to photodiode. Therefore the only way to improve low-light SNR is to reduce crosstalk, which makes the non-diagonal elements of the color-correction matrix (CCM) close to zero and thus reduces color noise [3]. The best way to improve crosstalk is to introduce a complete physical isolation between neighboring pixels, e.g., using deep-trench isolation (DTI). So far, a few attempts using DTI have been made to suppress silicon crosstalk. A backside DTI in as small as 1.12m-pixel, which is formed in the BSI process, is reported in [4], but it is just an intermediate step in the DTI-related technology because it cannot completely prevent silicon crosstalk, especially for long wavelengths of light. On the other hand, front-side DTIs for FSI pixels [5] and BSI pixels [6] are reported. In [5], however, DTI is present not only along the periphery of each pixel, but also invades into the pixel so that it is inefficient in terms of gathering incident light and providing sufficient amount of photodiode area. In [6], the pixel size is as large as 2.0m and it is hard to scale down with this technology for near 1.0m pitch because DTI width imposes a critical limit on the sufficient amount of photodiode area for full-well capacity. Thus, a new technological advance is necessary to realize the ideal front DTI in a small size pixel near 1.0m.","title":"7.1 A 1\/4-inch 8Mpixel CMOS image sensor with 3D backside-illuminated 1.12m pixel with front-side deep-trench isolation and vertical transfer gate"}}],"topWords":[{"weight":0.03306877200453201,"label":"core"},{"weight":0.021878912845965447,"label":"performance"},{"weight":0.021341348657774248,"label":"processor"},{"weight":0.01708564388480967,"label":"cpu"},{"weight":0.01682731190027878,"label":"cache"},{"weight":0.01493845670509386,"label":"power"},{"weight":0.013051741249249788,"label":"instruction"},{"weight":0.012601851157689482,"label":"high performance"},{"weight":0.01235576837998917,"label":"mobile"},{"weight":0.011683444258734388,"label":"chip"},{"weight":0.011542681991791679,"label":"design"},{"weight":0.011280867203101725,"label":"voltage"},{"weight":0.011253997233816836,"label":"high"},{"weight":0.010562946321968275,"label":"soc"},{"weight":0.010177083154877265,"label":"energy"},{"weight":0.00956455758555031,"label":"clock"},{"weight":0.009353144760892813,"label":"zen"},{"weight":0.009095363696072969,"label":"efficient"},{"weight":0.008944270090194821,"label":"die"},{"weight":0.00861891157061846,"label":"management"}],"topicIndex":18},{"topicId":"19","topDocs":[{"docId":"90","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Battery lifetime is the key feature in the growing markets of sensor networks and energy-management system (EMS). Low-power MCUs are widely used in these systems. For these applications, standby power, as well as active power, is important contributor to the total energy consumption because active sensing or computing phases are much shorter than the standby state. Figure 13.4.1 shows a typical power profile of low-power MCU applications. To achieve many years of battery lifetime, the power consumption of the chip must be kept below 1A during deep sleep mode. Another key feature of a low-power MCU for such applications is fast wake-up from deep-sleep mode, which is important for low application latency and to keep wake-up energy minimal. For fast wake-up, the system must retain its state and logged information during sleep mode because several-hundred microseconds are needed for reloading such data to memories. Conventional SRAM consumes much higher retention current than the required deep-sleep-mode current as shown in Fig. 13.4.1. Embedded Flash memories have limited write endurance on the order of 10 5  cycles making them difficult to use in applications that frequently power down. Embedded FRAM [1,2] has been used for this purpose and it could be used as a random-access memory as well as a nonvolatile memory. However, as a random-access memory, its slow operation and high energy consumption [1,2] limits performance of the MCU and battery lifetime. Furthermore, additional process steps for fabricating FRAM memory cells increase the cost of MCU. SRAM can operate at higher speed with lower energy without additional process steps, but high retention current makes it difficult to sustain data in deep-sleep mode. To solve this problem, we develop low-leakage current SRAM (XLL SRAM) that reduce retention current by 1000 compared to conventional SRAM and operate with less than 10ns access time. The retention current of XLL SRAM is negligible in the deep-sleep mode because it is much smaller than the amount of the deep-sleep-mode current of MCU, which is dominated by active current of the real-time clock and control logic circuits. By using XLL SRAM, the store and reload process during mode transitions can be eliminated and wake-up time from deep-sleep mode of MCU is reduced to few microseconds.

This trend necessitates assist circuits for SRAM to increase the immunity against variations, and many papers in this area [1-4] have been published. In this paper, we present an assist circuit suitable for the SRAMs in 20nm generation. Figure 13.3.1 compares local variations of SRAM cell transistors, pass-gate NMOS (PG), pull-down NMOS (PD) and pull-up PMOS (PU) for 28 and 20nm, showing degradation as the process advances. Noticeably, the NMOS transistors become worse than PMOS, which causes degradation in SRAM operating margin since SRAM characteristics such as static noise margin (SNM) are more sensitive to NMOS than PMOS. Figure 13.3.1 also shows the operational window enclosed by read and write immunity against local variations in 28 and 20nm. This indicates assist circuits must perform beyond the level established in previously published work to address SRAM variation in advanced technology nodes. Lowering wordline (WL) voltage level is one of the read-assist approaches. Lowering the supply voltage of PU in a cell (ARVDD) and negative bitline (BL) techniques are known to be effective for the write operation. These techniques, however, have side-effects: lowering the WL voltage degrades write margin and lowering ARVDD leads to higher power consumption and a long cycle-time. Furthermore, the negative BL technique can cause write errors in non-selected columns. Thus, it is necessary to select which assist technique should be applied depending on each process technology. In addition, the SRAM used in production generally include single-port SRAM (SP-SRAM) and dual-port SRAM (DP-SRAM), so the assist circuits to be applied should be effective for whole SRAM family.","title":"13.3 20nm High-density single-port and dual-port SRAMs with wordline-voltage-adjustment system for read\/write assists"}},{"docId":"224","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Resistive RAM (ReRAM) is a promising nonvolatile memory with low write energy, logic-process compatibility, and compact cell area.

STT-MRAM [1-4] is a good candidate for these applications due to its fast write speed, low-voltage write, and high endurance.

Compact 1T1MTJ arrays are suitable for high-density applications [5-6]; however, they use a power-hungry current-mode read scheme with a slow read speed due to the small RSM.

This has remained true with the introduction of the FinFET architecture, which counteracts short-channel effects (SCE) by partially enveloping the channel with the gate. For gate lengths  (L_)  below 20nm, however, even more disruptive architectures are under investigation in which the channel consists of a stack of wide and thin nanosheets surrounded by the gate on all sides (see Fig. 1). In such devices, reducing the thickness of the nanosheets improves gate control and thereby prevents SCE. Unfortunately, the mobility of carriers in silicon degrades significantly below a thickness of 3nm, owing to enhanced scattering due to thickness variations along the length of the channel. The channel mobility is further degraded by dangling bonds at the surfaces, which increase in relative importance as the thickness is scaled. The mobility penalty and associated drive current loss in thin layers of Si therefore poses a fundamental limitation to  L_  scaling in Si channel transistors.","title":"The Promise of 2-D Materials for Scaled Digital and Analog Applications"}},{"docId":"234","weight":0.26752819120704746,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"We present an 8b general-purpose microprocessor realized in a hybrid oxide-organic complementary thin-film technology.

A 60GHz wireless communication single-chip transceiver has not yet been reported due to large power consumption issues. However, by limiting the application to high-throughput proximity transmission, thermal issues arising in a single-chip have been overcome. A 2GHz broadband OFDM single-chip transceiver suffers from SNR degradation due to the reference clock (REFCLK) and baseband clock (BBCLK) spurs in RF\/analog circuits. Low frequency spurs in the clock generator (CLKPLL) due to the mixing of the ADC\/DAC sampling clock (SCLK) and other clocks such as REFCLK and BBCLK have been eliminated by careful frequency planning of those clocks. In addition to that, spur suppression in digital baseband and noise-tolerant RF\/analog circuit designs are employed. The spurs have been successfully suppressed to less than 35dBc. The chip achieves a PHY data-rate of 2.35Gb\/s and MAC throughput of 2.0Gb\/s at a distance of 4cm. Power consumption is scalable to the throughput by the introduction of fast Sleep and Awake modes.

Multi-level signaling such as differential PAM-4 [1] has been used to mitigate the loss of electrical channels by lowering the signal spectrum. Such an approach suffers from lower SNR tolerance as well as higher susceptibility to crosstalk and ISI as compared to differential signaling (DS). Coded differential approaches have been reported [2] to mitigate ISI. Our approach is a generalization of DS in which ternary values are transmitted on an 8-wire bus. The set of transmitted values belongs to a code consisting of 256 code-words called the 8b8w-code (8-bits-on-8-wires) [3]. The specific correlations in the code-words of the 8b8w-code eliminate transmit common-mode and simultaneous switching output (SSO) noise and allow for detection via self-referencing comparators (unlike PAM-4), which provides additional noise immunity.

This is typically done by an external power detector (PD), which increases area and cost. On the other hand, fully integrated power detectors are typically voltage-based [1-5] and only give the correct RF output power for a fixed load impedance. But in practice, antenna impedance variations will occur, causing VSWR mismatches that introduce an error in these voltage-based RF output power measurements. This paper presents a 5GHz WLAN PA with an on-chip true-RMS Power Detector, without any additional power loss or area overhead. The power detector is based on a magnetically coupled sense winding and takes advantage of transformer-based power combining and impedance transformation that has become common practice in nanometer CMOS RF PAs. The proposed power detector performs both an RF voltage and RF current measurement at the PA output and is therefore capable of performing a True power measurement, even under VSWR mismatches or load variations. This proposed power detector is implemented in 40nm standard CMOS and unlike earlier reported power detectors [1-4], it is integrated together with a 5GHz RF PA targeting the WLAN (IEEE 802.11a) communication standard.","title":"3.3 A transformer-coupled true-RMS power detector in 40nm CMOS"}},{"docId":"36","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"As an alternative to the conventional dual-loop architecture, reference-less CDR architectures have become more popular in industry because of their simplicity and flexibility [1-5].

To improve the efficiency of power amplifiers (PA), the trend is towards Class-AB and Class-B PAs that exhibit better energy efficiency compared to Class-A. However, Class-AB and -B biasing brings along large amplitude-to-phase-modulation (AM-PM) distortion which degrades EVM and ACPR.

This paper presents a 60GHz complementary Push-Pull PA, using both NMOS and PMOS transistors. An inverter-like architecture which uses both PMOS and NMOS results in the cancellation of AM-PM distortion which is particularly important in high-fidelity amplification of OFDM systems and high-order modulation schemes like 16- and 64-QAM, which are very sensitive to phase distortion.

Among all available frequency detectors (FDs), the stochastic divider-based approach has the widest frequency acquisition range and is well suited for sub-rate CDRs [1].

To minimize the bitcell area of the high-density SRAM bitcell, the number of fins (setting the channel width, W) of the pull-up PMOS (PU), passgate NMOS (PG) and pull-down NMOS (PD) transistors must be selected as 1:1:1. Since PU, PG, and PD have the same channel length (L), the ratio in geometry between the PU transistor and the PG transistor is equal to one. With the process variations, the strength of PU transistor can be much stronger than the PG transistor. A stronger PU transistor increases read stability of the SRAM bitcell but it degrades the write margin significantly and results in worse write-V DDMIN  issue.

Using a 2-dimensional array of transducers, objects can be localized in 3 dimensions. This paper presents an ultrasonic 3D gesture-recognition system that uses a custom transducer chip and an ASIC to sense the location of targets such as hands. The system block diagram is shown in Fig. 12.1.1. Targets are localized using pulse-echo time-of-flight methods. Each of the 10 transceiver channels interfaces with a MEMS transducer, and each includes a transmitter and a readout circuit. Echoes from off-axis targets arrive with different phase shifts for each element in the array. The off-chip digital beamformer realigns the signal phase to maximize the SNR and determine target location.","title":"12.1 3D ultrasonic gesture recognition"}},{"docId":"33","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"A fully-integrated single-chip CMOS transceiver with MAC and PHY for 60GHz proximity wireless communication is presented. A 60GHz wireless communication single-chip transceiver has not yet been reported due to large power consumption issues.

A 2GHz broadband OFDM single-chip transceiver suffers from SNR degradation due to the reference clock (REFCLK) and baseband clock (BBCLK) spurs in RF\/analog circuits. Low frequency spurs in the clock generator (CLKPLL) due to the mixing of the ADC\/DAC sampling clock (SCLK) and other clocks such as REFCLK and BBCLK have been eliminated by careful frequency planning of those clocks. In addition to that, spur suppression in digital baseband and noise-tolerant RF\/analog circuit designs are employed. The spurs have been successfully suppressed to less than 35dBc.

Ideally, the TR should be in excess of one octave, since this allows the easy synthesis of all frequencies below those directly generated by the VCOs via repeated frequency divisions by 2.

SNR at low-light conditions, which is a key performance metric, is determined by the sensitivity and crosstalk in pixels. To improve sensitivity, pixel technology has migrated from frontside illumination (FSI) to backside illumiation (BSI) as pixel size shrinks down. In BSI technology, it is very difficult to further increase the sensitivity in a pixel of near-1.0m size because there are no structural obstacles for incident light from micro-lens to photodiode. Therefore the only way to improve low-light SNR is to reduce crosstalk, which makes the non-diagonal elements of the color-correction matrix (CCM) close to zero and thus reduces color noise [3]. The best way to improve crosstalk is to introduce a complete physical isolation between neighboring pixels, e.g., using deep-trench isolation (DTI). So far, a few attempts using DTI have been made to suppress silicon crosstalk. A backside DTI in as small as 1.12m-pixel, which is formed in the BSI process, is reported in [4], but it is just an intermediate step in the DTI-related technology because it cannot completely prevent silicon crosstalk, especially for long wavelengths of light. On the other hand, front-side DTIs for FSI pixels [5] and BSI pixels [6] are reported. In [5], however, DTI is present not only along the periphery of each pixel, but also invades into the pixel so that it is inefficient in terms of gathering incident light and providing sufficient amount of photodiode area. In [6], the pixel size is as large as 2.0m and it is hard to scale down with this technology for near 1.0m pitch because DTI width imposes a critical limit on the sufficient amount of photodiode area for full-well capacity. Thus, a new technological advance is necessary to realize the ideal front DTI in a small size pixel near 1.0m.","title":"7.1 A 1\/4-inch 8Mpixel CMOS image sensor with 3D backside-illuminated 1.12m pixel with front-side deep-trench isolation and vertical transfer gate"}},{"docId":"61","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Despite versatility and low power consumption, direct-conversion transmitters suffer from a fundamental drawback: the local oscillator disturbance by the power amplifier, through unwanted electromagnetic or capacitive coupling [1,2].

The latter technique enables simpler GHz-range wideband (WB) operation with low power consumption, but such receivers navigate a tradeoff between sensitivity and blocker toleration. The narrowband (NB) direct  structure introduced in [3] combined RF N-path filtering, upconverted  RF feedback, and a second RF gain stage to obtain acceptable noise and linearity simultaneously. In this paper we present a WB direct  receiver, designed for programmable, inductorless operation in the long-term evolution (LTE) frequency division duplexing bands from 0.7 to 2.7GHz. The 40nm CMOS circuit uses a supply of 1.1V and provides RF channel bandwidths up to 20MHz, 37dB maximum gain, NF of 5.9 to 8.8dB, and 2dBm IIP3.

However, current active matrix OLED (AMOLED) displays on foil do not validate this power-efficient advantage, as too much power is lost in the AM backplane. AMOLED displays use the analog voltage on the gate of a drive transistor (e.g. M1 in Fig. 30.2.1) to control the pixel current and hence the pixel brightness. Accurate and uniform pixel currents can only be obtained when transistor M1 is driven is saturation. In highresolution technologies on foil, transistor parameters W, L and the mobility  are limited by technology, imposing a minimal V GS -V T  to obtain sufficient current, i.e. V GS -V T  > 4V for a-IGZO on foil [1]. Subsequently, to obtain saturation, V DS  > 4V, which translates in a static backplane power loss surpassing the OLED power consumption (see red stars in Fig 30.2.1). However, when the OLED pixel impedance around a specific reference current can be matched along a display column line, the accurate pixel current control can be imposed by current DACs implemented in external silicon display column drivers. In this work, we operate M1 as a switch and pixel intensity variations are obtained using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) of a predefined pixel current, i.e. 2A\/pixel [8080m 2 ] (which corresponds in our OLED technology to a light output of 2000Cd\/m 2 ). When, in a future implementation the external DACs are calibrated at 0.2A\/pixel, the full brightness would correspond to the typical display brightness of a portable PC, i.e. 200Cd\/m 2 . This concept enables us to reduce the display power voltage at full brightness from 8.2V in a classical AMOLED display on foil configuration to 5V (measured) and for future implementations even down to 4V (see Fig. 30.2.1). As the OLED current load remains equal, a corresponding static power reduction of the display (and increased battery lifetime) is obtained. Digital driving methods of AMOLED displays have been shown before. However,  techniques [2] still integrate charge packets on the gate of M1 and hence do not solve the power issue on foil. Other PWM techniques [3] activate only a single active line in the linedriver yielding difficulties to obtain color depths above 6 bits. When multiple independent linedrivers are implemented and their output is multiplexed to alternately drive a single select line, a higher color depth can be obtained [4]. This leads however to a bulky linedriver, which is hard to get within an e.g. 80m pitch.

Recent demonstrations with this technology include computation beyond the capabilities of today's most powerful supercomputers [1] and execution of quantum error correction (QEC) codes that can detect and correct either bit or phase flip errors [2]. These exciting results were enabled by low-error-rate quantum processors with tens of qubits and the supporting infrastructure to run these devices.

A further step to the realization of a fault-tolerant scalable quantum computer is presenting challenges in the field of engineering. It necessitates a microsystem operating at 4K in a dilution refrigerator, which would be inevitable to control thousands or millions of qubits sitting at 10mK. There have been IC implementations of pulse modulators generating qubit-controlling microwave signals [1 4]. The pulse modulation based on direct synthesis demonstrated feasibility of driving multiple qubits with frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) through one RF cable [1  3]. The first implementation of a full controller [1], which includes both read and write chains for spin qubits, demonstrated the highest level of integration. However, the previous work used external local oscillator (LO) sources for frequency synthesis. External feeding of LO requires precise matching; otherwise, a failure would cause leakage to the qubit driving output through PCB traces, resulting in AC-Stark shift of qubit state by unwanted tones at near-resonance. It becomes more problematic in FDM-based multi-qubit driving. Since the fidelity of qubit operations strongly relies on the quality of driving frequency, a low-noise LO generation by a phase-locked loop (PLL) is one of the most important factors [5]. The internal generation of LO gives additional benefits in superconducting qubit interface. It necessitates multiple LOs since the superconducting qubit uses microwave pulse driving for both read and write. To detect the state of a qubit through dispersive readout, the phase reflected from the readout resonator should be measured. Therefore, the driving pulses for the read and the write should be synchronized to a single reference timing. Using built-in PLLs sharing a single reference clock naturally solves this problem.","title":"A Cryo-CMOS Controller IC With Fully Integrated Frequency Generators for Superconducting Qubits"}},{"docId":"834","weight":0.42131583826057956,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Room-temperature control and detection of the nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond's spin-state has enabled magnetic sensing with high sensitivity and spatial resolution [1], [2].

EPR has applications in studying and monitoring a wide range of materials, starting from defects in semiconductors over free radicals in the blood to metal catalysts in hydrogen fuel production. EPR measurements are typically performed in moderate static magnetic fields around 0.3T, corresponding to EPR frequencies around  9 . This combination of field and frequency is commonly used due to the relative ease of generation of 0  3  magnetic fields with sufficient homogeneity as well as the required  9  frequency signal. However, access to higher frequencies and fields is strongly desirable due to higher spin polarization (with corresponding increased signal amplitude), higher spectral resolution, which allows, e.g., the determination of electronic and geometric structures of active centers in enzymes, and access to higher energy electronic transitions, such as those found in metal complexes or materials interesting for antiferromagnetic spintronics, explaining the ongoing research towards high-frequency EPR (HFEPR) with operating frequencies beyond  90 . Here, another strong driver of HFEPR is the field of dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), a method that can be used to boost the relatively poor sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) by transferring the intrinsically higher electron polarization to the nuclear spins.

Ideally, the TR should be in excess of one octave, since this allows the easy synthesis of all frequencies below those directly generated by the VCOs via repeated frequency divisions by 2.

This is a crucial requirement in modern radios, where there are more PLLs active at the same time, and particularly when (non-contiguous) carrier aggregation is implemented, since in this case the signal bands may be very close to each other. If an individual PLL is used for each band, the VCOs may oscillate very close to each other, or at frequencies that are harmonically related to each other, posing a very serious issue of mutual pulling through the respective magnetic field. And even if a single VCO is used [2], or two (or more) VCOs that are not harmonically related [3], it is nevertheless a good practice to design the tank inductor as insensitive as possible to external magnetic fields, which abound in and close to the radio IC.","title":"21.6 A 2.4-to-5.3GHz dual-core CMOS VCO with concentric 8-shaped coils"}},{"docId":"56","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Since the invention of radio, superheterodyne has been the architecture of choice for receivers (RX).

SNR at low-light conditions, which is a key performance metric, is determined by the sensitivity and crosstalk in pixels. To improve sensitivity, pixel technology has migrated from frontside illumination (FSI) to backside illumiation (BSI) as pixel size shrinks down. In BSI technology, it is very difficult to further increase the sensitivity in a pixel of near-1.0m size because there are no structural obstacles for incident light from micro-lens to photodiode. Therefore the only way to improve low-light SNR is to reduce crosstalk, which makes the non-diagonal elements of the color-correction matrix (CCM) close to zero and thus reduces color noise [3]. The best way to improve crosstalk is to introduce a complete physical isolation between neighboring pixels, e.g., using deep-trench isolation (DTI). So far, a few attempts using DTI have been made to suppress silicon crosstalk. A backside DTI in as small as 1.12m-pixel, which is formed in the BSI process, is reported in [4], but it is just an intermediate step in the DTI-related technology because it cannot completely prevent silicon crosstalk, especially for long wavelengths of light. On the other hand, front-side DTIs for FSI pixels [5] and BSI pixels [6] are reported. In [5], however, DTI is present not only along the periphery of each pixel, but also invades into the pixel so that it is inefficient in terms of gathering incident light and providing sufficient amount of photodiode area. In [6], the pixel size is as large as 2.0m and it is hard to scale down with this technology for near 1.0m pitch because DTI width imposes a critical limit on the sufficient amount of photodiode area for full-well capacity. Thus, a new technological advance is necessary to realize the ideal front DTI in a small size pixel near 1.0m.","title":"7.1 A 1\/4-inch 8Mpixel CMOS image sensor with 3D backside-illuminated 1.12m pixel with front-side deep-trench isolation and vertical transfer gate"}},{"docId":"61","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Despite versatility and low power consumption, direct-conversion transmitters suffer from a fundamental drawback: the local oscillator disturbance by the power amplifier, through unwanted electromagnetic or capacitive coupling [1,2].

However, current active matrix OLED (AMOLED) displays on foil do not validate this power-efficient advantage, as too much power is lost in the AM backplane. AMOLED displays use the analog voltage on the gate of a drive transistor (e.g. M1 in Fig. 30.2.1) to control the pixel current and hence the pixel brightness. Accurate and uniform pixel currents can only be obtained when transistor M1 is driven is saturation. In highresolution technologies on foil, transistor parameters W, L and the mobility  are limited by technology, imposing a minimal V GS -V T  to obtain sufficient current, i.e. V GS -V T  > 4V for a-IGZO on foil [1]. Subsequently, to obtain saturation, V DS  > 4V, which translates in a static backplane power loss surpassing the OLED power consumption (see red stars in Fig 30.2.1). However, when the OLED pixel impedance around a specific reference current can be matched along a display column line, the accurate pixel current control can be imposed by current DACs implemented in external silicon display column drivers. In this work, we operate M1 as a switch and pixel intensity variations are obtained using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) of a predefined pixel current, i.e. 2A\/pixel [8080m 2 ] (which corresponds in our OLED technology to a light output of 2000Cd\/m 2 ). When, in a future implementation the external DACs are calibrated at 0.2A\/pixel, the full brightness would correspond to the typical display brightness of a portable PC, i.e. 200Cd\/m 2 . This concept enables us to reduce the display power voltage at full brightness from 8.2V in a classical AMOLED display on foil configuration to 5V (measured) and for future implementations even down to 4V (see Fig. 30.2.1). As the OLED current load remains equal, a corresponding static power reduction of the display (and increased battery lifetime) is obtained. Digital driving methods of AMOLED displays have been shown before. However,  techniques [2] still integrate charge packets on the gate of M1 and hence do not solve the power issue on foil. Other PWM techniques [3] activate only a single active line in the linedriver yielding difficulties to obtain color depths above 6 bits. When multiple independent linedrivers are implemented and their output is multiplexed to alternately drive a single select line, a higher color depth can be obtained [4].

Ideally, the TR should be in excess of one octave, since this allows the easy synthesis of all frequencies below those directly generated by the VCOs via repeated frequency divisions by 2. At the same time, the oscillation spectrum should be affected as little as possible by spurious (common-mode) magnetic fields impinging on the inductor coil in the VCO tank. This is a crucial requirement in modern radios, where there are more PLLs active at the same time, and particularly when (non-contiguous) carrier aggregation is implemented, since in this case the signal bands may be very close to each other. If an individual PLL is used for each band, the VCOs may oscillate very close to each other, or at frequencies that are harmonically related to each other, posing a very serious issue of mutual pulling through the respective magnetic field.

Recently, oscillator designs have evolved from the conventional single-core to multi-core types [1], [2]. With the parallel cross-coupled pairs and LCtanks, a multicore oscillator can efficiently reduce the phase noise level, while increasing the chip size and limiting frequency tuning range. To extend the operation bandwidth, mode-switching multi-core oscillators [3], [7] are developed and enable phase-noise reduction and tuning-range extension simultaneously.

Low phase noise is crucial to enable advanced modulation formats for high communication data-rates. Much effort has been made to improve the phase noise performance of the mm-wave LOs. A lower frequency voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) together with a frequency multiplier can lower the phase noise [1]; however, the high-order harmonic components in VCOs are usually very weak, which requires additional power-consuming mm-wave amplification stages to satisfy the LO swing requirement. For single mm-wave fundamental VCOs, the minimal achievable phase noise is bounded by the smallest realizable inductor that displays a high Q factor. To avoid the small inductor problem, N oscillators with relatively large inductors can be coupled together to improve the phase noise by 10log 10 (N) [2-5]. Authors in [2] presented a quad-core bipolar VCO working around 15GHz as shown in Fig. 20.3.1 (Left), where four one-turn inductors are star-connected with the active cores placed in the middle. Resistors (Rc) are added to avoid undesired multi-tone concurrent oscillations. However, the four one-turn inductors still suffer from the Q-factor drop when the inductance decreases, thus limiting the highest achievable oscillation frequency. Besides, VDD at the inductor central taps and VSS at the tail current source are far from each other, making the V DD -V SS  current return path long. This path has to be carefully modeled in simulations, especially in the mm-wave frequency range, where the return path inductance is comparable to the tank inductance. Instead of the star-connected topology, authors in [3] presented a circular-connected quad-core VCO working close to 30GHz, where the inductors are arranged in a circular topology as shown in Fig. 20.3.1 (Middle). The destructive coupling between the inner edges inside a small inductor is eliminated. Therefore, the minimal realizable inductance is further reduced while keeping a high Q factor. The central taps are connected by narrow metal traces to avoid latching and mode ambiguity. The VCO adopts a CMOS configuration, which limits the highest operating frequency. It would be difficult for this topology to be adopted in NMOS-only VCOs because the central taps have to be resistively isolated to suppress unwanted modes; therefore, they cannot be connected to the AC-ground power supply simultaneously as required by the NMOS-only configuration. Due to the lack of harmonic impedance control in the circular inductors, extra tail filtering transformers are added to improve the phase noise.","title":"20.3 A 60GHz 186.5dBc\/Hz FoM Quad-Core Fundamental VCO Using Circular Triple-Coupled Transformer with No Mode Ambiguity in 65nm CMOS"}},{"docId":"1182","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"The quest for voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) with lower phase noise and higher efficiency continues.

The oscillator is thus required to have a low phase noise as well as a high figure-of-merit (FoM). Recently, to reduce the noise sensitivity of the LC oscillator, various harmonic shaping techniques [1] [3] have been reported. By setting the differential-mode (DM) [1], [2] or common-mode (CM) [1], [3] resonances at specific harmonic frequencies, the impulse sensitive function (ISF) is reduced, and a high FoM could be achieved. However, to meet the strict relationship between fundamental frequency and resonances, the frequency tuning plan is complex, and the frequency range is limited. Besides, the minimum phase noise performance is still limited by the reduced power supply of advanced process and the maximum power taken by a single-core resonate tank. To overcome these limitations, the low-phase-noise oscillators have evolved from the single-core to multi-core types [4], [5]. By coupling N oscillators together, it is possible to burn N times higher power and decrease the phase noise by 10log(N), with the FoM unchanged. Nevertheless, the multi-core coupling method needs to be designed carefully to prevent concurrent oscillations [5].

However, it is still challenging for dual-mode VCOs to achieve a competitive FoM while covering an octave FTR at oscillation frequencies  (F_OSC)  above 6GHz [1].

Given the supply voltage, the phase noise in LC oscillators is reduced by scaling down the inductance and increasing power consumption. However, the Q degradation with too-small inductors sets a lower bound on phase noise [1], [2]. To overcome this limit, oscillators evolved from a single-core to multicore topologies, where N oscillators are coupled to scale down phase noise by 10log(N).

To meet the phase noise requirement, one can use a subharmonic oscillator followed by frequency multipliers to improve the phase noise performance [1]. However, the frequency multipliers and the necessary extra amplification stages consume a large chip area and power. On the other hand, mm-wave fundamental VCOs suffer from the Q drop as inductance becomes too small due to the inner-edge deconstructive coupling in single-turn inductors [2]. To overcome this problem, multicore technologies are used in mm-wave fundamental oscillators [2  6]. By coupling N cores together, the phase noise can be improved by 10log(N). At the same time, the inductance in each core can be large for the given phase-noise requirement, thus alleviating the small-inductor problem. The key to a multicore oscillator design is to effectively synchronize each oscillator core. The left top of Fig. 9.3.1 shows the schematic of the resistance-coupled multicore oscillator [3  5], where resistors are placed between the corresponding output nodes of each core. The resistance-coupling scheme is good for a small number of cores, such as 2 cores or 4 cores, where the output node of each core can be physically close to each other. In a many-core extension, as shown in the left-middle of Fig. 9.3.1, some of the coupling resistors stretch over a long distance, which increases their parasitic capacitance and contributes to tank mismatch. It also suffers from the trade-off between the lock range and parasitic capacitance. The right top of Fig. 9.3.1 shows the schematic of the proposed transformer-based mode-rejection-coupled multicore oscillator. In this scheme, the oscillator active core shares the transformer tank with its two adjacent cores, and isolation resistors are placed in the middle of gate coils. The resistor damps the Q of the transformer in the common mode, forcing the voltage signals at the two sides of the transformer to be differential, therefore synchronizing the oscillator cores. The transformer-based mode-rejection-coupled scheme has several advantages over the resistance-coupled scheme. First, the isolation resistors are transparent in the differential mode, therefore providing robust coupling without the parasitic capacitance penalty. Second, because the two sides of transformers are connected to two different active cores, they do not have to be physically close to each other, thus enabling the slab type inductors, which can achieve simultaneous small inductance and high Q as in [2]. Third, since the resistors are only placed at local-gate central taps, the transformer-based mode-rejection-coupled scheme is suitable for the many-core extension. Similar mode-rejection-coupled ideas have been used in [2, 6]. Single inductors, instead of transformers, are used in [2], which only applies to CMOS configuration due to the power-supply issue. Triple-coupled-transformers are used in [6], where the source coil is much shorter than the coils at gate and drain terminals, making it difficult to extend to more than 4 cores.

Various harmonic-shaping techniques have been reported to reduce the noise sensitivity [1][3], and thus improve the FoM. By utilizing the mutual coupling of an inductor and a single-ended capacitor, the implicit common-mode technique [1] can set the common-mode (CM) resonance at  2f_L0  without an extra CM resonator. Then, the phase noise degradation due to the triode operation is eliminated, while the flicker noise upconversion can be minimized. However, the mutual coupling  k  pushes CM to a higher frequency by cancelling the magnetic flux, which reduces the inductor quality factor (Q) in CM by a factor of  1-k  as shown in Fig. 8.3.1-top-left. Meanwhile, the Q of the single-ended switched capacitor is inherently lower than the differential type for the same tuning range. At a mm-wave frequency, the switched capacitor Q becomes more critical, and the reduced coil diameter of a small inductor decreases the Q due to the inner-edge destructive coupling. Currently, to overcome the destructive coupling of a small inductor and to increase the maximum power taken by a single-core resonate tank, the mode-rejection multi-core oscillators [4][6] are reported, where multiple inductors are arranged in a circular shape with a larger diameter. Then, the inductance of each core can be reduced while keeping a high Q. By coupling N oscillators together, the phase noise can be reduced by  10log(N)  with the FoM unchanged.

In addition to the series resonance technique, the commonly used method to reduce the phase noise is to introduce a high resistance at the second harmonic frequency. However, the head filter in [2] that generates the high resistance occupies additional area and cannot prevent noise current injection at the GND. Although separate filters are added at the VDD and GND, as reported in [3], the noise current passing through the head common-mode inductance is coupled in the same phase to the noise current of the bottom inductance, which increases the total injected noise to some extent. To solve the problem of the additional area for the common-mode resonator, the authors in [4] merged the common-mode filter with the differential-mode resonator at the cost of the reduced switching speed of the gate and worsened phase noise and the ability to cut off the noise-injection path from the VDD coupled to the gate.

Nevertheless, the frequency mismatch between the oscillator cores tends to penalize the PN improvement and FoM of a coupled oscillator (Fig. 8.2.1 upper). Figure 8.2.1 (bottom) depicts two approaches to implement a quad-core oscillator by connecting four cores using: 1) spiral inductors (transformers) in a concentric way [2], [3], or 2) slab inductors (transformers) in a circular way [1], [4]. Since the outputs of either of the two cores in the first approach can be directly connected via a short metal trace with a small resistance, it benefits from a small PN penalty induced by the frequency mismatch. But the poor  Q  of the small spiral inductor limits its PN. On the contrary, the latter approach features a circular inductor (transformer) with an improved  Q  but suffers from a large PN penalty due to the frequency mismatch between two non-adjacent cores, i.e., cores #1 (#2) and #3(#4), since the non-adjacent cores are not directly connected and synchronized.","title":"8.2 A 22.4-to-26.8GHz Dual-Path-Synchronized Quad-Core Oscillator Achieving 138dBc\/Hz PN and 193.3dBc\/Hz FoM at 10MHz Offset from 25.8GHz"}},{"docId":"323","weight":0.7118717769032489,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Wideband mm-Wave and terahertz (THz) applications, including high data-rate communications, high-resolution radar and spectroscopy, require wideband signal sources.

Recently, low-V IN  charge pumps (CPs) for energy harvesting has been compared with DC-DC converters using a large inductor [1-3]. CPs introduced in [1] and [2] use the advanced process technology to push V IN  down to the subthreshold region. The CP in [1] introduces a forward-body-biasing (FBB) technique, which improves the voltage conversion efficiency (VCE) for low V IN  but shows poor power conversion efficiency (PCE). The CP in [2] achieves the lowest operation voltage. However, the design with a 10-stage CP provides low output power. This paper presents a CP with switching-body-biasing (SBB), adaptive-dead-time (AD), and switch-conductance (SW-G) enhancement techniques to improve the PCE for low V IN  as well as to extend the maximum load current.","title":"23.1 A 0.15V-input energy-harvesting charge pump with switching body biasing and adaptive dead-time for efficiency improvement"}},{"docId":"30","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Requirements for high bandwidth and low power continue to increase in servers and consumer electronics.

SNR at low-light conditions, which is a key performance metric, is determined by the sensitivity and crosstalk in pixels. To improve sensitivity, pixel technology has migrated from frontside illumination (FSI) to backside illumiation (BSI) as pixel size shrinks down. In BSI technology, it is very difficult to further increase the sensitivity in a pixel of near-1.0m size because there are no structural obstacles for incident light from micro-lens to photodiode. Therefore the only way to improve low-light SNR is to reduce crosstalk, which makes the non-diagonal elements of the color-correction matrix (CCM) close to zero and thus reduces color noise [3]. The best way to improve crosstalk is to introduce a complete physical isolation between neighboring pixels, e.g., using deep-trench isolation (DTI). So far, a few attempts using DTI have been made to suppress silicon crosstalk. A backside DTI in as small as 1.12m-pixel, which is formed in the BSI process, is reported in [4], but it is just an intermediate step in the DTI-related technology because it cannot completely prevent silicon crosstalk, especially for long wavelengths of light. On the other hand, front-side DTIs for FSI pixels [5] and BSI pixels [6] are reported.

However, current active matrix OLED (AMOLED) displays on foil do not validate this power-efficient advantage, as too much power is lost in the AM backplane. AMOLED displays use the analog voltage on the gate of a drive transistor (e.g. M1 in Fig. 30.2.1) to control the pixel current and hence the pixel brightness. Accurate and uniform pixel currents can only be obtained when transistor M1 is driven is saturation. In highresolution technologies on foil, transistor parameters W, L and the mobility  are limited by technology, imposing a minimal V GS -V T  to obtain sufficient current, i.e. V GS -V T  > 4V for a-IGZO on foil [1]. Subsequently, to obtain saturation, V DS  > 4V, which translates in a static backplane power loss surpassing the OLED power consumption (see red stars in Fig 30.2.1). However, when the OLED pixel impedance around a specific reference current can be matched along a display column line, the accurate pixel current control can be imposed by current DACs implemented in external silicon display column drivers. In this work, we operate M1 as a switch and pixel intensity variations are obtained using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) of a predefined pixel current, i.e. 2A\/pixel [8080m 2 ] (which corresponds in our OLED technology to a light output of 2000Cd\/m 2 ). When, in a future implementation the external DACs are calibrated at 0.2A\/pixel, the full brightness would correspond to the typical display brightness of a portable PC, i.e. 200Cd\/m 2 . This concept enables us to reduce the display power voltage at full brightness from 8.2V in a classical AMOLED display on foil configuration to 5V (measured) and for future implementations even down to 4V (see Fig. 30.2.1). As the OLED current load remains equal, a corresponding static power reduction of the display (and increased battery lifetime) is obtained. Digital driving methods of AMOLED displays have been shown before. However,  techniques [2] still integrate charge packets on the gate of M1 and hence do not solve the power issue on foil. Other PWM techniques [3] activate only a single active line in the linedriver yielding difficulties to obtain color depths above 6 bits. When multiple independent linedrivers are implemented and their output is multiplexed to alternately drive a single select line, a higher color depth can be obtained [4]. This leads however to a bulky linedriver, which is hard to get within an e.g. 80m pitch.

However, the cross-regulation and power consumption are two main issues of the previously reported SIMO converters [1-5].

The comparator-based controlled SIMO converters are investigated in [3, 4] and the cross-regulation in most channels is improved due to the fast response of the comparator. However, since the channel that is last connected to inductor is inevitably regulated by the accumulative error of all channels to balance the overall inductor current, every load transition at other outputs will introduce serious cross-regulation [3] and load-regulation problem [4] in the channel.

In the previous distributed DLDOs [1 3], even though all LDO outputs are connected to drive the power-delivery network, the LDOs operate independently using their own controller, which occupies a large portion of the LDO size. Therefore, the current density in these types of structures is low. In [4], the distributed DLDO uses a dual-loop structure. In this scheme, the high current density can be achieved because the four shared global controllers control the 16 local LDOs (LLDOs) for highly accurate regulation. However, the LLDOs consume large quiescent current since they operate at a switching frequency of several-GHz for a fast transient response. Besides, the load current range is narrow due to the small switching duty-cycle range of the power FETs.

Such usage conditions usually cause  V_MIN  to depend on  V_IN , which translates into cost (test-time increase) and\/or power\/performance  (V_MIN  guard bands) penalties.

The DLDO was implemented in a 10nm process node, as part of a multi-domain SOC. High-level power-plane partitioning is shown in Fig. 14.3.1 (top). Figure 14.3.1 (bottom) illustrates the high-level DLDO block scheme. The chosen architecture comprises a digital power stage and a digital controller for the following reasons: (a) digital design features weaker process dependency and better design convergence; (b) potentially higher  I_LOAD  and regulation BW (iso-area); and (c) better performance in low-DO  (dropout =V_IN -V_OUT_-TARGET )  conditions and easier transition to a bypass (BP) mode to enable lowest possible  V_IN  (e.g.,  V_IN  of 20mV leads to  P_IN  1 W for a 45W product). Some digital DLDO designs [13] feature a dual-loop architecture: a relatively-Iow-BW linear control and a high-BW, event-driven fast control (i.e. Non-Linear Control (NLC)). From an SOC standpoint, the disadvantage of the NLC is that its charge injection is DO dependent. The NLC efficiency drops with  V_IN  and depends on an SOC power scenario.

Low-Dropout (LDO) regulators, in contrast, do not rely on large passives and can be scaled more easily to fit the domain demands, but have poor efficiency if the various load domains have widely different voltage requirements or rely on aggressive dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). Switched-Capacitor Voltage Regulators (SCVRs) offer the promise of providing scalable voltage conversion without having to rely on in-package components but have so far not lived up to their expectations. Conventional SCVR topologies have demonstrated both high current density and efficiency thanks to the use of high-density on-die capacitors [2] or using an approach where MIM capacitors are placed on top of the load domain while minimizing the active silicon area of the converter- and thus cost [3]. But because they do not maintain high efficiency across a wide voltage range, they have some of the same drawbacks as LD0s. The Continuous-Scalable Conversion-Ratio (CSCR) topology [4], on the other hand, can maintain high efficiency across voltage conversion ratios (VCRs) but has never been demonstrated with high current density [5]. In this work, a Phase-Merging-Turbo (PMT) technique is proposed that can significantly increase the current capability of CSCR SCVRs.","title":"14.4 A Monolithic 26A\/mm2Imax, 88.5"}},{"docId":"1214","weight":0.11369713144572449,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"High-performance many-core processors and GPUs demand 100s of Watts of power in a single voltage\/power domain on chip, operating below 1V.

SNR at low-light conditions, which is a key performance metric, is determined by the sensitivity and crosstalk in pixels. To improve sensitivity, pixel technology has migrated from frontside illumination (FSI) to backside illumiation (BSI) as pixel size shrinks down. In BSI technology, it is very difficult to further increase the sensitivity in a pixel of near-1.0m size because there are no structural obstacles for incident light from micro-lens to photodiode. Therefore the only way to improve low-light SNR is to reduce crosstalk, which makes the non-diagonal elements of the color-correction matrix (CCM) close to zero and thus reduces color noise [3]. The best way to improve crosstalk is to introduce a complete physical isolation between neighboring pixels, e.g., using deep-trench isolation (DTI). So far, a few attempts using DTI have been made to suppress silicon crosstalk. A backside DTI in as small as 1.12m-pixel, which is formed in the BSI process, is reported in [4], but it is just an intermediate step in the DTI-related technology because it cannot completely prevent silicon crosstalk, especially for long wavelengths of light. On the other hand, front-side DTIs for FSI pixels [5] and BSI pixels [6] are reported. In [5], however, DTI is present not only along the periphery of each pixel, but also invades into the pixel so that it is inefficient in terms of gathering incident light and providing sufficient amount of photodiode area. In [6], the pixel size is as large as 2.0m and it is hard to scale down with this technology for near 1.0m pitch because DTI width imposes a critical limit on the sufficient amount of photodiode area for full-well capacity. Thus, a new technological advance is necessary to realize the ideal front DTI in a small size pixel near 1.0m.","title":"7.1 A 1\/4-inch 8Mpixel CMOS image sensor with 3D backside-illuminated 1.12m pixel with front-side deep-trench isolation and vertical transfer gate"}},{"docId":"61","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Despite versatility and low power consumption, direct-conversion transmitters suffer from a fundamental drawback: the local oscillator disturbance by the power amplifier, through unwanted electromagnetic or capacitive coupling [1,2].

However, current active matrix OLED (AMOLED) displays on foil do not validate this power-efficient advantage, as too much power is lost in the AM backplane. AMOLED displays use the analog voltage on the gate of a drive transistor (e.g. M1 in Fig. 30.2.1) to control the pixel current and hence the pixel brightness. Accurate and uniform pixel currents can only be obtained when transistor M1 is driven is saturation. In highresolution technologies on foil, transistor parameters W, L and the mobility  are limited by technology, imposing a minimal V GS -V T  to obtain sufficient current, i.e. V GS -V T  > 4V for a-IGZO on foil [1]. Subsequently, to obtain saturation, V DS  > 4V, which translates in a static backplane power loss surpassing the OLED power consumption (see red stars in Fig 30.2.1). However, when the OLED pixel impedance around a specific reference current can be matched along a display column line, the accurate pixel current control can be imposed by current DACs implemented in external silicon display column drivers. In this work, we operate M1 as a switch and pixel intensity variations are obtained using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) of a predefined pixel current, i.e. 2A\/pixel [8080m 2 ] (which corresponds in our OLED technology to a light output of 2000Cd\/m 2 ). When, in a future implementation the external DACs are calibrated at 0.2A\/pixel, the full brightness would correspond to the typical display brightness of a portable PC, i.e. 200Cd\/m 2 . This concept enables us to reduce the display power voltage at full brightness from 8.2V in a classical AMOLED display on foil configuration to 5V (measured) and for future implementations even down to 4V (see Fig. 30.2.1). As the OLED current load remains equal, a corresponding static power reduction of the display (and increased battery lifetime) is obtained. Digital driving methods of AMOLED displays have been shown before. However,  techniques [2] still integrate charge packets on the gate of M1 and hence do not solve the power issue on foil. Other PWM techniques [3] activate only a single active line in the linedriver yielding difficulties to obtain color depths above 6 bits. When multiple independent linedrivers are implemented and their output is multiplexed to alternately drive a single select line, a higher color depth can be obtained [4].

A subordinate DC-DC converter is also required for voltage regulation or battery charging, which reduces the overall power-conversion efficiency (PCE) due to the 2-stage structure. To overcome these limitations, the resonant current-mode receiver (RCM-RX) has been proposed for direct battery charging [3] and voltage regulation [4,5]. The RCM-RX has two operation phases: a resonance phase (PH re ) that accumulates energy in the LC tank during optimal resonant cycles (N OPT ) to track the maximum efficiency [3], and a charging phase (PH ch ) that delivers the energy of the LC tank to the output, when the resonant current (I AC ) is at its peak. However, the RCM-RX typically operates at low resonant frequency f RESO  (50kHz to 1MHz) because it is challenging to accurately detect the peak timing of I AC  due to the intrinsic delay and offset of the comparator used in the peak timing detector. Operating at low f RESO  causes the coil size to increase, making a burden on a size-constrained implant. In addition, the RCM-RX has a LC-tank resonance-loss interval PH ch , which hinders optimal power transfer from the transmitter (TX) to the RX because the reactive impedance is not cancelled out but appears on the TX side. Because the LC tank and the output are not isolated during PH ch , the power-transfer efficiency (PTE) can also be affected by load variation, such as the battery-voltage (V BAT ) variation.

First, an impedance-matching technique that achieves zero-voltage switching (ZVS) and zero voltage-derivative switching (ZVDS) on a Gallium Nitride (GaN) switch is needed to reduce the efficiency loss caused by hard switching (HS) and reverse conduction (RC). Second, under high-power conditions, it is desirable to reduce the voltage and current stress on each switch and passive components. Third, there is a need to reduce the number of external components for compact size. In [1] and [2], an external capacitor array for impedance matching occupies a large printed circuit board (PCB) area. If the output power is as high as 100W, the controlled switch needs to withstand high voltage stresses of up to 600V. The fractional-capacitance tuning technique in [3] achieves a wide range of equivalent capacitance, but there are still high-voltage-stress problems similar to [1,2].

Many existing WPT designs operated in open-loop [3] -[5]; or achieved voltage regulation but only in the RX [6], with the TX remained unregulated and designed to operate at full capacity, thus degraded E2E efficiency at light-load conditions.

However, a single coil transmitter (TX) has its limitation in one dimension in Fig. 30.8.1, if the receiver (RX) has an angle  with respect to the TX [2]. When  increases to  90^ , the grade of coupling expressed by the coupling factor k decreases to zero. At the same time, the communication strength is weakened between the RX and the TX sense coil, which is connected in parallel with the TX main coil, and is easily affected by noise. Through the TX2 coil perpendicular to TX1, the RX can still receive energy in case  changes. However, when TX2 sense coil takes over the charging control, it does not have any communication with the TX1, causing power loss. Therefore, this paper proposes a three dimension (3D) WPT system with the ability of controlling X, Y, and Z axes coils through the central controller (bottom left of Fig. 30.8.1). The central controller communicates with the three TXs in the vector detection control loop. Since the RX changes position in 3D relative to each TX, the central controller needs to detect the vector of RX based on the position of each TX. Although the k sensor in [3] can extract the coupling coefficient [4], the coupling factor in 3D is still a problem. Thus, the vector detector loop is proposed to determine the k factor for each TX in 3D. The central controller will decide the power distribution of each TX and effectively control the power transfer of the TX for high efficiency. To ensure the communication between the RX and each TX will not be affected by ambient noise and interference from the adjacent TXs, the noise cancellation technique is proposed (bottom right of Fig. 30.8.1). If communication is established in the communication main coil, the induced magnetic flux in the auxiliary coil will enhance the received signal. Conversely, if communication is not established, the induced magnetic flux in the auxiliary coil will cancel the signal received in the communication main coil for noise cancellation. That is, when one of the TXs communicates with the RX, the other two TXs have no influence on the central controller.","title":"30.8 3D Wireless Power Transfer with Noise Cancellation Technique for 62dB Noise Suppression and 90.1"}},{"docId":"790","weight":0.36215855951719567,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Leveraging the ubiquitous WiFi infrastructure to wirelessly power sensors can enable perpetually powered sensors for several monitoring and asset-tracking IoT applications.

This means fuel cells last longer with light loads and Li-ion batteries output more power across shorter periods. Therefore, when the peak power is far greater than the average power, which, for example, is typically the case in wireless sensors, a hybrid source can occupy less space than a single source [1]. Still, managing a fuel cell and a battery to supply a load and recharge the battery, which also acts as an output, with little space is difficult. Switched-inductor circuits are appealing in this context because they draw and supply more power with higher efficiency than their linear and switched-capacitor counterparts.

Therefore, it is expected to achieve better performance with lower SRAM V DDMIN . However, the quantized sizing of the channel width and length has drawbacks for conventional 6T-SRAM bitcell scaling. To minimize the bitcell area of the high-density SRAM bitcell, the number of fins (setting the channel width, W) of the pull-up PMOS (PU), passgate NMOS (PG) and pull-down NMOS (PD) transistors must be selected as 1:1:1. Since PU, PG, and PD have the same channel length (L), the ratio in geometry between the PU transistor and the PG transistor is equal to one. With the process variations, the strength of PU transistor can be much stronger than the PG transistor. A stronger PU transistor increases read stability of the SRAM bitcell but it degrades the write margin significantly and results in worse write-V DDMIN  issue. Figure 13.5.1(a) shows a contention condition between PU and PG transistors of a 6T-SRAM bitcell for the write operation. During the write operation, the PU transistor impedes the ability of the PG transistor to pull the storage node (S) from V DD  to ground. The bitcell may suffer a write failure at the stronger PU with weaker PG condition caused by the device variations. Two techniques have been proposed to improve the high density SRAM bitcell write V DDMIN : 1) negative bit-line voltage (NBL) to increase the strength of PG transistor and 2) lower cell V DD  (LCV) to weaken PU transistor strength [1-5].

Ideally, the TR should be in excess of one octave, since this allows the easy synthesis of all frequencies below those directly generated by the VCOs via repeated frequency divisions by 2.

SNR at low-light conditions, which is a key performance metric, is determined by the sensitivity and crosstalk in pixels. To improve sensitivity, pixel technology has migrated from frontside illumination (FSI) to backside illumiation (BSI) as pixel size shrinks down. In BSI technology, it is very difficult to further increase the sensitivity in a pixel of near-1.0m size because there are no structural obstacles for incident light from micro-lens to photodiode. Therefore the only way to improve low-light SNR is to reduce crosstalk, which makes the non-diagonal elements of the color-correction matrix (CCM) close to zero and thus reduces color noise [3]. The best way to improve crosstalk is to introduce a complete physical isolation between neighboring pixels, e.g., using deep-trench isolation (DTI). So far, a few attempts using DTI have been made to suppress silicon crosstalk. A backside DTI in as small as 1.12m-pixel, which is formed in the BSI process, is reported in [4], but it is just an intermediate step in the DTI-related technology because it cannot completely prevent silicon crosstalk, especially for long wavelengths of light. On the other hand, front-side DTIs for FSI pixels [5] and BSI pixels [6] are reported. In [5], however, DTI is present not only along the periphery of each pixel, but also invades into the pixel so that it is inefficient in terms of gathering incident light and providing sufficient amount of photodiode area. In [6], the pixel size is as large as 2.0m and it is hard to scale down with this technology for near 1.0m pitch because DTI width imposes a critical limit on the sufficient amount of photodiode area for full-well capacity. Thus, a new technological advance is necessary to realize the ideal front DTI in a small size pixel near 1.0m.","title":"7.1 A 1\/4-inch 8Mpixel CMOS image sensor with 3D backside-illuminated 1.12m pixel with front-side deep-trench isolation and vertical transfer gate"}},{"docId":"61","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Despite versatility and low power consumption, direct-conversion transmitters suffer from a fundamental drawback: the local oscillator disturbance by the power amplifier, through unwanted electromagnetic or capacitive coupling [1,2].

However, current active matrix OLED (AMOLED) displays on foil do not validate this power-efficient advantage, as too much power is lost in the AM backplane. AMOLED displays use the analog voltage on the gate of a drive transistor (e.g. M1 in Fig. 30.2.1) to control the pixel current and hence the pixel brightness. Accurate and uniform pixel currents can only be obtained when transistor M1 is driven is saturation. In highresolution technologies on foil, transistor parameters W, L and the mobility  are limited by technology, imposing a minimal V GS -V T  to obtain sufficient current, i.e. V GS -V T  > 4V for a-IGZO on foil [1]. Subsequently, to obtain saturation, V DS  > 4V, which translates in a static backplane power loss surpassing the OLED power consumption (see red stars in Fig 30.2.1). However, when the OLED pixel impedance around a specific reference current can be matched along a display column line, the accurate pixel current control can be imposed by current DACs implemented in external silicon display column drivers. In this work, we operate M1 as a switch and pixel intensity variations are obtained using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) of a predefined pixel current, i.e. 2A\/pixel [8080m 2 ] (which corresponds in our OLED technology to a light output of 2000Cd\/m 2 ). When, in a future implementation the external DACs are calibrated at 0.2A\/pixel, the full brightness would correspond to the typical display brightness of a portable PC, i.e. 200Cd\/m 2 . This concept enables us to reduce the display power voltage at full brightness from 8.2V in a classical AMOLED display on foil configuration to 5V (measured) and for future implementations even down to 4V (see Fig. 30.2.1). As the OLED current load remains equal, a corresponding static power reduction of the display (and increased battery lifetime) is obtained. Digital driving methods of AMOLED displays have been shown before. However,  techniques [2] still integrate charge packets on the gate of M1 and hence do not solve the power issue on foil.

However, the cross-regulation and power consumption are two main issues of the previously reported SIMO converters [1-5].

The comparator-based controlled SIMO converters are investigated in [3, 4] and the cross-regulation in most channels is improved due to the fast response of the comparator. However, since the channel that is last connected to inductor is inevitably regulated by the accumulative error of all channels to balance the overall inductor current, every load transition at other outputs will introduce serious cross-regulation [3] and load-regulation problem [4] in the channel.

With proper driving signals, the PT is utilized as an electric scalpel. It converts an electric signal into physical displacements for various electro-surgical functions, such as ultrasonic vessel sealing and dissecting. The major challenge is to precisely regulate and quickly build a mechanical power up when changing between various surgical functions. The pulse width modulation (PWM) mainly bases its design on a small signal model, thus, does not often fit for the large signal transient satisfactorily. This problem becomes even worse when changing load impedance due to the pressure upon the surgical tip. The sliding mode control (SMC) has reliable and fast performance for nonlinear large signal applications. However, the SMC cannot be simply applied since the electric scalpel is significantly different from generic DC-DC converters. In this paper, a SMC controller for an electric scalpel system is designed for the first time, featuring compact size, automatic resonance tracking, and fast response for electrosurgical operation. The architecture of the electric scalpel system has three nested loops: Loop I is a bandpass filter-based oscillator (BPO) for power generation. The conventional close-loop driving solution dynamically senses the PT's impedance, executes the power-factor correction (PFC), and tracks the target resonance . However, the complex sensing causes delay and does not fit for drastic load changing. The BPO method utilizes the PT's intrinsic nature as the bandpass filter, automatically captures the dominant resonance, and features a simpler architecture with less hardware cost. For power regulation, Loop II is a current-fed DC-AC converter with an enhanced SMC that achieves high regulation accuracy for steady-state and fast response for large load transition. Loop III utilizes a phase-locked loop (PLL) to discriminate the non-longitudinal modes in the time-domain, and prevents the scalpels from being stuck. This method features higher sensitivity than the conventional filter based approach. Compared with the discrete solutions, the monolithic integration reduces the delay of Loop I and enhances the Q and resonant efficiency. Moreover, the conventional bulky system with discrete mainframe box can be integrated into the scalpel's handler, improving the feasibility for the minimum invasive surgery.","title":"21.4 A reduced-order sliding-mode controller with an auxiliary PLL frequency discriminator for ultrasonic electric scalpels"}},{"docId":"742","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Harvesting energy from ambient vibrations with piezoelectric transducers is an alternative solution for the surging needs of self-powered devices, such as IoT devices, condition and structural monitoring devices, or biomedical implants.

The simplest way to harvest AC energy is to apply a full-bridge rectifier (FBR). However, the FBR causes a sinusoidal current of the PT  (I _P)  to charge\/discharge the inherent capacitor of the PT  (C_P)  whenever the  I_P  direction changes, resulting in a large charge loss. To address this issue, synchronized-switch harvesting-on-inductor (SSHI) and synchronous electric-charge extraction (SECE) techniques have been proposed. The conventional SSHI reduces the charge loss by using the bias flip technique, which inverts the voltage across the  C_P(V_PT)  with  LC_P  resonance [1] (Fig. 30.1.1, top left). Although it increases the extracted power and the voltage of the maximum power point compared to the FBR, an expensive and large inductor (L) with a high quality factor (Q) is required for high flip efficiency  (_Flip) . Otherwise, if a low Q inductor is adopted, a half-cycle resonance flip requires both an accurate zero current detector (ZCD) and a large inductor current  (I _L) , which cause large controller loss and conduction loss  (P_c) , respectively. Similarly, the SECE uses a quarter-cycle resonance, which requires a high Q inductor as well [2]. Also, a synchronized-switch harvesting-on-capacitor (SSHC) has also been proposed [3] (Fig. 30.1.1, bottom left). Using a commercial PT, not custom MEMS, the SSHC needs off-chip capacitors with several tens of nF, similar to the  C_P  of a commercial PT. Because hard charging of the capacitor incurs a large redistribution loss, the flip process must be split, which requires numerous off-chip capacitors. Moreover, an adaptive control according to the operating point of the PT is impossible due to the fixed split phase, which is determined in the design stage. Structures that split the flip process with a relatively small inductor have also been proposed [46]. However, their precise half-cycle resonance flip requires accurate ZCD and limits their ability to reduce the inductor to less than tens of  H . Also, they need multiple controllers with large quiescent current  (I _Q)  for different duties and use a considerable number of power elements, such as switches and diodes.","title":"30.1 A Scalable N-Step Equal Split SSHI Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting Circuit Achieving 1170"}},{"docId":"589","weight":0.7376935241083022,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Piezoelectric actuators are used in a growing range of applications, e.g., haptic feedback systems, cooling fans, and microrobots.

This means fuel cells last longer with light loads and Li-ion batteries output more power across shorter periods. Therefore, when the peak power is far greater than the average power, which, for example, is typically the case in wireless sensors, a hybrid source can occupy less space than a single source [1].

With many WSNs, the required amount of power during the sensing mode is small but increases significantly, often much higher than the instantaneous harvesting power, during the wireless data transmission.

Therefore, it is expected to achieve better performance with lower SRAM V DDMIN . However, the quantized sizing of the channel width and length has drawbacks for conventional 6T-SRAM bitcell scaling. To minimize the bitcell area of the high-density SRAM bitcell, the number of fins (setting the channel width, W) of the pull-up PMOS (PU), passgate NMOS (PG) and pull-down NMOS (PD) transistors must be selected as 1:1:1. Since PU, PG, and PD have the same channel length (L), the ratio in geometry between the PU transistor and the PG transistor is equal to one. With the process variations, the strength of PU transistor can be much stronger than the PG transistor. A stronger PU transistor increases read stability of the SRAM bitcell but it degrades the write margin significantly and results in worse write-V DDMIN  issue. Figure 13.5.1(a) shows a contention condition between PU and PG transistors of a 6T-SRAM bitcell for the write operation. During the write operation, the PU transistor impedes the ability of the PG transistor to pull the storage node (S) from V DD  to ground. The bitcell may suffer a write failure at the stronger PU with weaker PG condition caused by the device variations. Two techniques have been proposed to improve the high density SRAM bitcell write V DDMIN : 1) negative bit-line voltage (NBL) to increase the strength of PG transistor and 2) lower cell V DD  (LCV) to weaken PU transistor strength [1-5].

A global clock requires costly full-chip margining and significant power and area for clock distribution, while synchronizing data FIFOs add power, performance, and area overhead per clock crossing.

The transceiver features a low-jitter TX, half-rate calibrated RX slicer with folded active inductor and a wide-range PLL (20 to 28GHz) with low-power half-rate clock driver using programmable distributed inductors. It operates from a standard 0.9V supply and the power consumption for line-side transceiver is 780mW for 28Gb\/s. Additionally the chipset integrates a system interface that is CAUI-compliant, composed of a 10-lane data bus operating at 9.95 to 11.2Gb\/s. In default mode it converts 100GbE (1010 Gb\/s) signal to a 425Gb\/s line signal and vice versa. The line-side interface can also be reconfigured as 40GbE, with both line- and system-side operating at 411.2Gb\/s.","title":"2.2 A 780mW 428Gb\/s transceiver for 100GbE gearbox PHY in 40nm CMOS"}},{"docId":"50","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"A wide range of memory configurations exist in today's high-speed digital systems to meet platform-specific bandwidth, power, capacity, and cost constraints.

Ideally, the TR should be in excess of one octave, since this allows the easy synthesis of all frequencies below those directly generated by the VCOs via repeated frequency divisions by 2. At the same time, the oscillation spectrum should be affected as little as possible by spurious (common-mode) magnetic fields impinging on the inductor coil in the VCO tank. This is a crucial requirement in modern radios, where there are more PLLs active at the same time, and particularly when (non-contiguous) carrier aggregation is implemented, since in this case the signal bands may be very close to each other. If an individual PLL is used for each band, the VCOs may oscillate very close to each other, or at frequencies that are harmonically related to each other, posing a very serious issue of mutual pulling through the respective magnetic field.

SNR at low-light conditions, which is a key performance metric, is determined by the sensitivity and crosstalk in pixels. To improve sensitivity, pixel technology has migrated from frontside illumination (FSI) to backside illumiation (BSI) as pixel size shrinks down. In BSI technology, it is very difficult to further increase the sensitivity in a pixel of near-1.0m size because there are no structural obstacles for incident light from micro-lens to photodiode. Therefore the only way to improve low-light SNR is to reduce crosstalk, which makes the non-diagonal elements of the color-correction matrix (CCM) close to zero and thus reduces color noise [3]. The best way to improve crosstalk is to introduce a complete physical isolation between neighboring pixels, e.g., using deep-trench isolation (DTI). So far, a few attempts using DTI have been made to suppress silicon crosstalk. A backside DTI in as small as 1.12m-pixel, which is formed in the BSI process, is reported in [4], but it is just an intermediate step in the DTI-related technology because it cannot completely prevent silicon crosstalk, especially for long wavelengths of light. On the other hand, front-side DTIs for FSI pixels [5] and BSI pixels [6] are reported. In [5], however, DTI is present not only along the periphery of each pixel, but also invades into the pixel so that it is inefficient in terms of gathering incident light and providing sufficient amount of photodiode area. In [6], the pixel size is as large as 2.0m and it is hard to scale down with this technology for near 1.0m pitch because DTI width imposes a critical limit on the sufficient amount of photodiode area for full-well capacity. Thus, a new technological advance is necessary to realize the ideal front DTI in a small size pixel near 1.0m.","title":"7.1 A 1\/4-inch 8Mpixel CMOS image sensor with 3D backside-illuminated 1.12m pixel with front-side deep-trench isolation and vertical transfer gate"}},{"docId":"61","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Despite versatility and low power consumption, direct-conversion transmitters suffer from a fundamental drawback: the local oscillator disturbance by the power amplifier, through unwanted electromagnetic or capacitive coupling [1,2].

To enhance the transient response and to reduce the size of off-chip components, DC-DC converters switching in the 10MHz range are studied recently. When switching at a high frequency, efficiency is compromised as the switching loss becomes significant.

Present voltage regulators (VRs) combat these challenges by using bulky output capacitor (C OUT ) arrays that could add up to over 100F. However, this practice is untenable for next-generation APs, which have severely limited PCB area and require fast dynamic voltage scaling.

Each mobile device is usually equipped with a Li-ion battery having voltage that varies from a minimum of 2.7V to a maximum of 4.2V. Therefore, as the battery voltage decreases with time, a DC-DC converter is required for a regulated supply lower or higher than the battery voltage. A simple buck converter is not suited for this case, since step-up conversion is not available [1]. Instead, a non-inverting buck-boost converter can be a solution over the entire range of the battery voltage [1-4]. Many research studies related to buck-boost converters operated on Li-ion batteries set the target output voltage at around 3.4V [3,4]. Since Li-ion batteries have a wide plateau from 3.6V to 3.8V and a small energy storage below the plateau, DC-DC converters are generally operated on step-down mode at most of the battery voltage range, as shown in Fig. 10.4.1 top. Notwithstanding, step-up conversion is also required for extracting the energy below the plateau even if it is a small amount in the battery. Therefore, in DC-DC converters, it is critical to maintain high efficiency over the whole range of the battery voltage when it operates on both step-down and step-up modes to prolong the battery usage effectively. However, if the conventional buck-boost topology of Fig. 10.4.1 bottom-left is used for step-up and step-down purposes, there are always two switches (S 1  and S 3 ) conducting in the main current path through the inductor. Thus, the switches become large in size to minimize the conduction loss. As the switching loss also increases when the switch size is larger, the efficiency of this structure is usually lower than that of the simple buck (or boost) converter [1]. In this respect, this paper proposes a topology named a flying-capacitor buck-boost (FCBB) converter suitable for such an application by obtaining both step-up and step-down operations with high efficiency throughout the whole range of the battery voltage.","title":"10.4 A hybrid inductor-based flying-capacitor-assisted step-up\/step-down DC-DC converter with 96.56"}},{"docId":"747","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"DC-DC boost converters are widely used to increase the supply voltage in various applications, including LED drivers, energy harvesting, etc. [1-5].

To meet such a wide range and fine resolution output voltage and current regulation, the flyback converter with the secondary-side-regulation (SSR) control scheme providing the direct output voltage and current feedback is adopted [2].

On the other hand, buck converters can reach a good efficiency over a wide continuous VCR range. Yet, they need a bulky inductor, which significantly degrades the power density. To address the power density and efficiency tradeoff, hybrid converters composed of both inductor and capacitor are among popular solutions [1  4]. When compared with the traditional buck converter, these hybrid converters feature lower voltage swing (smaller current ripple) of the inductor, higher switching frequency, and a larger duty cycle (D) for the same VCR, alleviating the requirements on the inductor, and resulting in higher power density.

Since both V OA  and V OB  can draw energy from  V_IN  during majority of the switching cycle, the output voltage ripple can be effectively reduced in steady state. Each inductor current of the DSD-DO is half of that in the SIDO [1][3], which reduces conduction loss and output voltage ripple  (V_OA(B)) .

For the  V_CF  balance, prior works [1], [2] adjusted the duration of the  C_F  charging and discharging phase  (_CH,_DIS)  using two mismatched duties  (D_1,D_2)  modulated by the calibration loop. However, that caused sub-harmonic oscillations in the inductor current  (I_L) , which enlarged  P_COND  in  R_L  proportional to the frequency. In addition, the bandwidth (BW) limit of the  V_CF -cal loop by the  V_0  control loop and the repetitive  _CH  and  _DIS  every cycle cause difficulty of immediate  V_CF cal in the start-up (Fig. 30.5.1, top left). Since it can result in breakdown and reliability issues for transistors, it is hard to mass produce the MLBST. Moreover, for the stability of the  V_CF -cal loop, an additional compensator that uses bulky passive components is necessary. Another structure that does not depend on the  V_CF -cal loop was proposed, but it needed an additional capacitor and incurred a surge current with redistribution losses due to the repetitive capacitor hard charging [3] (Fig. 30.5.1, middle left). Meanwhile, in power converters, the current mode control (CMC) is preferred thanks to the fast dynamic performance, over current protection, etc. But it is hard to apply it to the MLBST because of the mode transition issue. In the 3-level (3L) BST, there are two operation modes, mode-1  (_M1)  and mode-2  (_M2) . Prior CMC 3L converter changed the mode between  _M1  and  _M2  by the forced mode selection signal intermittently every pre-determined period at the mode transition point  (2V_INV_0)  [2]. This was subject t0  V_0  fluctuation due to the DC offset of  I_L  between two modes (Fig. 30.5.1, bottom left). To solve the above issues, we propose the following: 1) a fully state-based phase selection (FSPS) technique which is capable of the fast  V_CF  -cal, stable start-up, and smooth mode transition without the  I_L  sub-harmonics of the  3LBST;2 ) a comparator-based low-power  C_F  -charqinq and discharging phase selector ( C_F  -CDPS) that does not require an additional compensator, and simultaneously enables both real-time  V_CF  sensing and calibration signal generation; 3) an adaptive slope generator (ASG) for optimal slope compensation and smooth mode transition in a wide I\/O range of CMC.","title":"30.5 A 95.3"}},{"docId":"1682","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"DC-DC converters are widely used in energy harvesting systems for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) from energy sources. It is desirable to accommodate different energy sources (a wide input voltage  V_IN  range), together with a wide range of output voltage  V_OUT  range, from down-to-0.5V to up-to-2V (for button battery). Therefore, a buck-boost converter with high efficiency over a wide voltage conversion ratio (VCR) range is favorable. To reduce the volume and cost, switched-capacitor (SC) converters are in demand. However, a conventional SC only obtains good efficiency at discontinuous VCRs [1] (Fig. 30.7.1). This stems from the large voltage swing  ( V_CF)  on the flying capacitors  C_F  at non-optimum VCRs, leading to large charge sharing loss  (P_CSL)  and  C_F  bottom plate (BP) parasitic capacitance loss (proportional to   V_CF^2) . Multi-phase continuously scalable-conversion-ratio SC (CSC) converters [25] split the large   V_CF  into small steps, with the help of multiple internal voltage rails from the  C_F  of the adjacent phases, and the out-phasing technique [2]. For example, in a CSC step-down converter (Fig. 30.7.1), the  C_F  top plate (TP) in each phase connects to either  V_IN, V_OUT , or the  M  internal TP rails  (V_T1  to  V_TM) , while the bottom plate connects to either  V_OUT , ground  V_SS  or  N  internal BP rails  (V_B1 to V_BN)  . Then the  V_CF  step is   V_T  when TP connects to an internal rail:   V_T=(V_IN-V_OUT)\/(2M+1) . Likewise, the  V_CF  step becomes   V_B  when BP connects to an internal rail:   V_B=V_OUT\/(2N+1) . This reduces the  P_CSL  and BP parasitic losses at non-optimum VCRs, and hence allows a high efficiency over a continuous VCR range. The CSC step-up converter [3] shares the same benefit. Yet, with a fixed  M+N  value (amount of resources consumed), once at a non-optimum VCR, e.g.  V_OUT  becomes small, the reduction in   V_B  is too small such that the efficiency improvement is negligible, while the increased   V_T  degrades the efficiency greatly, as shown in Fig. 30.7.1.","title":"A Continuously Scalable-Conversion-Ratio SC Converter with Reconfigurable VCF Step for High Efficiency over an Extended VCR Range"}},{"docId":"1705","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"In recent years, USB Power Delivery (USB PD) is playing an increasingly important role in the field of consumer electronics. The USB PD 3.1 extends the delivering voltage up to 48V, which requires a buck-boost converter with extreme conversion ratio  (CR= V_OUT\/V_IN)  range from 0.1,10, high-voltage (HW) stress switches, and fast transient response. Into the bargain, the USB Type-C interface with USB PD specification allows power delivery through a single port, which brings about the necessity for bi-directional power converter. To fulfill this task, one of the most common proposals is to implement two power converters for each direction, but this method will be costly to accomplish and will complicate the designs for controllers. Although the Three-level Buck-Boost converter (TLBB) in [1] can provide buck-boost conversion when  V_2 > 2V_1  (top left of Figure 11.7.1), node  V_x  will be 2 times  V_1 , which leads to inductor charging in both   1, 2 , and fails to transfer power from  V_2  to  V_1 . To transfer power from  V_2  to  V_1  by using the double step-down converter (DSD) [2],  V_1  needs to be 4 times larger than  V_2  due to the limit of CR. In prior DC-DC converters, it is hard to achieve both wide-range CR and bi-directional power conversion. Thus, this paper proposes a symmetric hybrid buck-boost converter (SHBB), which contains two adjustable voltage switched-capacitor (AVSC) cells to satisfy the specifications mentioned above, as well as bi-directional power transmission. Conventional buck-boost (CBB) converter can reach full-range CR, but it encounters low CR=0.1 in the case of 48-to-5V conversion, leading to difficulty in driver and controller designs. The bottom-left of Figure 11.7.1 shows the CR range comparison chart with state-of-the-arts. The DSD converter [2] can provide extreme CR (24V to 1 V) with relatively wider duty cycles, but its maximum CR is limited to 0.25, which is not qualified for USB PD 3.1. Regarding boost conversion, the hybrid boost converter [3] and 3-switch boost converter [4] provide CR larger than 4, but they still fail to meet USB PD 3.1 requirements. The state-of-the-art buck-boost converters [1], [5] can operate in both buck and boost modes but the maximum CR is only 2. Furthermore, since the input and output voltage will vary from 5V to 48V, to tolerate high voltage stress over 96V  (2V_in)  in [5], 48V  (V_in)  in CBB, and [1], the usage of 60V HV process is unavoidable, which increases fabrication cost and decreases efficiency.","title":"11.7 A Wide 0.1-to-10 Conversion-Ratio Symmetric Hybrid Buck-Boost Converter for USB PD Bidirectional Conversion"}},{"docId":"1316","weight":0.8839906363217641,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"High conversion-ratio (CR) DC-DC boost converters are essential for LED backlighting in smartphone and tablet displays.

This not only limits the converter switching frequency  f_SW  but also results in a large inductor current ripple  i_L . As high CR also leads to a large average inductor current  I_  under a given output current  I_0 , the power efficiency of the CB converter would be significantly degraded due to enlarged inductor conduction loss with large  i_L  and  I_ .

Meanwhile, current slew rate can be improved by extending single-phase to multiphase operation. However, when a converter powers light load, power loss caused by added phases adversely affects the efficiency. Active phase count (APC) was thus proposed to manage the number of active phases judiciously to load by sensing average inductor current [3,4]. However, the inherent sensing delay drastically slows down the phase adding\/dropping actions and degrades load transient response. On the other hand, phase current imbalance among phase sub-converters could cause hot spots, jeopardizing system reliability. Upgrading from conventional current-mode hysteretic control, we propose a simple synchronized adaptive window (SAW) hysteretic control which automatically adjusts the hysteretic window to speed up the transient response.

However, one of the power switches has to withstand a voltage stress of  V_IN+V_OUT  in [2] or  2V_IN  in [3], and thus a high-voltage process or stacked transistors is needed, which increases the fabrication cost and degrades the current density. Topologies using more power switches and flying capacitors are proposed in [4], [5] to overcome the voltage stress issue. However, the chip current density is significantly compromised and the switching loss is also increased. Moreover, compared with [1], the inductor current is not reduced in [2] or only reduced in the boost mode in [35], which causes high conduction loss.","title":"30.6 A 98.6"}},{"docId":"442","weight":0.6047675308825206,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Wide input rails (12V to 100V) are common in today's automotive and industrial systems.

Wide-input-range integrated VRs, however have difficulty to simultaneously achieve high frequency (HF) operation and high power efficiency. Previous hard-switching (HS) high-input-voltage (HV) buck regulators can only operate at a low frequency of 100s of kHz in order to limit the dominant switching power loss PSW, that occurs at the converter switching node [1,2]. Low-frequency operation however results in using bulky inductors of 100s of H, significantly increasing the bill-of-material cost and the converter volume. Three-level converters (TLCs) are effective to reduce the required inductance by doubling the frequency at the switching node and allow using lower-voltage-rating power transistors in HV conditions. However, the concern of large PSW in HV conditions would still limit the HS TLC converter to operate in the MHz range. Moreover, the TLC needs the voltage across its flying capacitor to be balanced at half the input voltage; otherwise power transistors could be damaged during operation. In HF HV conditions, the capability of high-speed flying-capacitor self-balancing is even more crucial, but it is not addressed in prior 3-level DC-DC regulators [3,4].

However, it is still challenging to robustly control a DSD converter to achieve fast transient responses. Hysteretic control is widely used in the buck converters for its simple structure and fast responses. However, it may not be feasible to apply hysteretic control to a DSD converter as the on times of the two phases must have 180 phase shift and cannot be overlapped. PWM control with fast Type-III compensation [2] is another attractive option, but it suffers from an inherent delay up to half of a switching period when responds to a load transient, as will be explained later. In [1], an adaptive on\/off time (AO2T) control approach is proposed to improve the responses by extending the on time during the transient. However, the 10 8.2s  is longer than 16 switching periods for a load step of only 1A and a complicated phase mirroring circuit is also needed.

However, the cross-regulation and power consumption are two main issues of the previously reported SIMO converters [1-5].

The comparator-based controlled SIMO converters are investigated in [3, 4] and the cross-regulation in most channels is improved due to the fast response of the comparator. However, since the channel that is last connected to inductor is inevitably regulated by the accumulative error of all channels to balance the overall inductor current, every load transition at other outputs will introduce serious cross-regulation [3] and load-regulation problem [4] in the channel.

Any crosstalk will result in excessive or insufficient energy in other outputs, resulting in severe voltage ripple. In the upper left of Fig. 17.7.1, when there is any load change on V_O2, crosstalk will occur at V_O1 and V_O4. On the other hand, in the discontinuous-conduction-mode (DCM) control [6, 7], if any one of the multiple outputs changes from light load to heavy load, serious crosstalk occurs due to the extension of the switching period T_SW, as shown in the upper right of Fig. 17.7.1. Although constant frequency control can avoid the expansion of T_SW [8], the limited peak inductor current will reduce the driving capability (I_LOAD(MAX)=100 mA [8]). In this paper, the proposed SIMO converter, shown at the bottom left of Fig. 17.7.1, uses an adaptive switchable CCM and DCM (ASCD) technique that takes advantage of the high driving capability of CCM and the advantage of reducing crosstalk in DCM under light loads. To effectively reduce the crosstalk in CCM (Mode 1  in this paper), a 5-input crosstalk-reduction error amplifier (CREA) with a feedback rotator is proposed to reduce the shortcomings of hardware overhead in [1 10]. For achieving low crosstalk and high driving capability under medium load, the SIMO converter works in a combination of stacked DCM and sequential DCM, which are classified as Mode 2  to Mode 4  to change the energy distribution path of each output (Fig. 17.7.1 bottom right).

The three-level topology applies three different voltages, V in  1\/2V in  and V SS , to the node V X . The operation mode is determined by the duty cycle, i.e., the node V x  swings between 1\/2V in  and V SS  when duty cycle (D <; 0.5), and between 1\/2V in  and V in , otherwise (D>0.5).

In general, the restrained output voltage ripple and the flatter inductor current (I L ) slope seriously result in worse transient response and severe cross-regulation (CR) problems, respectively. Results show that the three-level SITO converter achieves a smaller output voltage ripple in steady state, but it causes the problems of slower transient response time, longer recovery time, larger overshoot\/undershoot, and severe CR.

These voltage domains can be supplied by multiple buck converters that increase platform size     weight, or by a single converter followed by multiple point-of-Ioad LDOs that degrade overall power efficiency. Single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) converters promise a more balanced solution for these critical trade-offs [14] but are vulnerable to significant cross-regulation preventing it from scaling to > 1W powers [1]. While SIMO converters in continuous conduction mode (CCM) can enable higher power with specialized circuits to reduce cross regulation [45], they are susceptible to random simultaneous load transients across multiple outputs that can disrupt a balanced inductor current waveform. On the other hand, isolating inductor in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) and separating each output's inductor cycle via an independent-charging scheme can effectively eliminate cross-regulation. However, large inductances with lower peak currents can limit output power [13] and low operating frequency in DCM can worsen droops due to longer wait times, thus necessitating larger output decoupling capacitors.","title":"11.3 A 1.8W High-Frequency SIMO Converter Featuring Digital Sensor-Less Computational Zero-Current Operation and Non-Linear Duty-Boost"}},{"docId":"954","weight":0.2783127180724291,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Increased switching frequency of power devices for power electronics allows for compact and lightweight circuit implementations for variety of applications, including power factor corrections, DC\/DC converters, and motor drive inverters.

In addition, it is difficult for an on-chip-capacitor-based power-transfer system to achieve high isolation voltage and high output power at the same time with a reasonable silicon area. Coreless-micro-transformer-based power-transfer systems [2]-[3] operate at 160 to 330MHz with coil inductance of 10s of nH. It is very difficult to boost the efficiency at such high operation frequency. Meanwhile, the high-frequency operation also poses challenges to electromagnetic interference (EMI) control.

Though over 100Mb\/s data-rate has been demonstrated with white LEDs in the laboratory, the high-frequency modulation is hardly supported by commonly used dimmable drivers with switching converters to regulate LED current. In these drivers, the changing slope of LED current is limited by both low loop BW and large inductors and capacitors [1].

State-of-the-art LED drivers employ the SIMO topology with four channels in Fig. 12.7.1, to deliver energy to each LED using the time-multiplexing (TM) control technique [2-4], in which the luminance is controlled by the dimming signals. Two major shortcomings for such approaches are: (1) Sequential dimming signals; and (2) Current cross-regulation (CCR) effects. In [2], the LED drivers with TM control result in only 9b color resolution at the dimming frequency of 1.5kHz, which may cause flicker hazard. Besides, the complete white-red-green-blue (WRGB) sequence needs a total of four switching periods to light up the 4 LEDs separately. On the other hand, due to inherent rising and falling delay of the hysteretic current control (HCC) circuit, t dr  and t df  respectively, the CCR effect seriously affects the accuracy of the controller when the inductor current slope is varied.

However, even with GaN FETs, hard-switching (HS) power converters would still suffer from considerable turn-on V-I overlap loss and dV\/dt kickback at high input voltages, degrading the light-load power efficiency, limiting the switching frequency (f SW ) to 100s of kHz, and compromising the converter reliability.

In [4], although a proper gate driver is reported to minimize the reverse conduction loss of the GaN-based ZVS converter, the converter light-load power efficiency is still considerably degraded by the power loss of the ZVS branch.

Conventional papers report on research and development of 8K ultra-high-definition television (UHDTV) systems, 8K full-resolution cameras [1], and 8K 240fps cameras that employ stacked sensors [2]. In these camera systems, a rolling-shutter method is used for scanning, since a global-shutter method has an area tradeoff between the photoelectric conversion region and the charge storage region [3-5]. However, this leads to a shutter distortion problem during the high-speed imaging and synchronization of multi-viewpoint imaging. To overcome this problem, a CMOS image sensor is developed that has an 8K4k resolution, a 60fps frame rate, and a 450ke -  saturation signal, with an organic photoconductive film (OPF) laminated on the pixel circuits. Even with small (e.g., 3) pixels, a global shutter can be realized without degradation of the saturation signal [6]. However, there still remains a requirement to achieve 8K4K resolution at 60fps readout speed. There are three potential strategies to achieve this: 1) high-speed cancellation of reset noise in single storage-type global shutter pixels, 2) high-speed readout with a long vertical signal line, and 3) high-saturation in global-shutter mode. For 1), in the conventional case, a feedback amplifier (FBAMP) is allocated to each column to affect noise cancellation, but there is a long noise suppression time due to the large time constant of the vertical signal line. An in-pixel noise canceller is developed to shorten the noise suppression time even when the length of the vertical signal line becomes four times longer than with a Full High Definition (FHD) sensor. Moreover, to utilize the advantages of the OPF image sensor's stacked structure, high-capacitance Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) capacitors are allocated in the metal interconnect area.

High DR can be realized if the integration variable is time. A variety of means to achieve high DR have been proposed in the literature, for example, a method that provides a plurality of detection capacitors (LOFIC,) or a method of preventing saturation by adding low-sensitivity pixels.

For mobile and automotive applications, a small form factor while maintaining a low parasitic light sensitivity (PLS) and low noise is crucial. In conventional backside illuminated (BSI) charge-domain GS image sensors, a light-shielding structure over the storage area must be formed in order to suppress the influence of parasitic light during the readout operation. Therefore, the introduction of such a light-shielding structure reduces the effective photodiode area, which results in a loss of full-well capacity (FWC), light sensitivity of the sensor, and pixel scalability.","title":"5.5 A 2.1e Temporal Noise and 105dB Parasitic Light Sensitivity Backside-Illuminated 2.3m-Pixel Voltage-Domain Global Shutter CMOS Image Sensor Using High-Capacity DRAM Capacitor Technology"}},{"docId":"1502","weight":0.483612291239887,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"The CMOS image sensor, which incorporates a silicon photodiode array and a signal processor on a chip, or in a multi-die stack, has become an indispensable part of our daily lives.

Accordingly, such imagers target ultra-low power\/pixel as a key efficiency metric, as opposed to the energy figure-of-merit (FOM) commonly adopted for battery-powered systems.

SNR at low-light conditions, which is a key performance metric, is determined by the sensitivity and crosstalk in pixels. To improve sensitivity, pixel technology has migrated from frontside illumination (FSI) to backside illumiation (BSI) as pixel size shrinks down. In BSI technology, it is very difficult to further increase the sensitivity in a pixel of near-1.0m size because there are no structural obstacles for incident light from micro-lens to photodiode. Therefore the only way to improve low-light SNR is to reduce crosstalk, which makes the non-diagonal elements of the color-correction matrix (CCM) close to zero and thus reduces color noise [3]. The best way to improve crosstalk is to introduce a complete physical isolation between neighboring pixels, e.g., using deep-trench isolation (DTI). So far, a few attempts using DTI have been made to suppress silicon crosstalk. A backside DTI in as small as 1.12m-pixel, which is formed in the BSI process, is reported in [4], but it is just an intermediate step in the DTI-related technology because it cannot completely prevent silicon crosstalk, especially for long wavelengths of light. On the other hand, front-side DTIs for FSI pixels [5] and BSI pixels [6] are reported. In [5], however, DTI is present not only along the periphery of each pixel, but also invades into the pixel so that it is inefficient in terms of gathering incident light and providing sufficient amount of photodiode area. In [6], the pixel size is as large as 2.0m and it is hard to scale down with this technology for near 1.0m pitch because DTI width imposes a critical limit on the sufficient amount of photodiode area for full-well capacity. Thus, a new technological advance is necessary to realize the ideal front DTI in a small size pixel near 1.0m.","title":"7.1 A 1\/4-inch 8Mpixel CMOS image sensor with 3D backside-illuminated 1.12m pixel with front-side deep-trench isolation and vertical transfer gate"}},{"docId":"951","weight":0.18836514264249032,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"CMOS X-ray detectors used in industrial and medical equipment should provide a full image depth even for a specific region of interest, and require high resolution, low noise, and wide DR in a wafer-scale detector [1], [4].

The system block diagram is shown in Fig. 12.1.1. Targets are localized using pulse-echo time-of-flight methods. Each of the 10 transceiver channels interfaces with a MEMS transducer, and each includes a transmitter and a readout circuit. Echoes from off-axis targets arrive with different phase shifts for each element in the array. The off-chip digital beamformer realigns the signal phase to maximize the SNR and determine target location.","title":"12.1 3D ultrasonic gesture recognition"}},{"docId":"33","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"A fully-integrated single-chip CMOS transceiver with MAC and PHY for 60GHz proximity wireless communication is presented. A 60GHz wireless communication single-chip transceiver has not yet been reported due to large power consumption issues. However, by limiting the application to high-throughput proximity transmission, thermal issues arising in a single-chip have been overcome. A 2GHz broadband OFDM single-chip transceiver suffers from SNR degradation due to the reference clock (REFCLK) and baseband clock (BBCLK) spurs in RF\/analog circuits. Low frequency spurs in the clock generator (CLKPLL) due to the mixing of the ADC\/DAC sampling clock (SCLK) and other clocks such as REFCLK and BBCLK have been eliminated by careful frequency planning of those clocks. In addition to that, spur suppression in digital baseband and noise-tolerant RF\/analog circuit designs are employed. The spurs have been successfully suppressed to less than 35dBc. The chip achieves a PHY data-rate of 2.35Gb\/s and MAC throughput of 2.0Gb\/s at a distance of 4cm. Power consumption is scalable to the throughput by the introduction of fast Sleep and Awake modes.

Meanwhile, chip scale packaging or laser diode mounting minimizes L stray  and significantly reduces rise time t R  and fall time t F , achieving subnanoseconds tPand tens of centimeters distance resolution (right of Fig. 29.6.1). Under high speed V command , the gate resistor prevents the device being damaged [4], but it limits the switching frequency and increases losses. The adaptive triple-slope gate driver [5] is not free from process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations and the falling slope is indeterminate. If a short pulse width is applied to [4] [5], a slight imbalance between t R  and t F  will cause the average laser current I LASER , Avg to change, which changes V BUS  and distorts I LASER , and then DC\/DC takes a long time to regulate V BUS . Therefore, this paper proposes a digital-type GaN driver with a laserdiode-peak-current-correction (LDPCC) loop and a current-pulse-balancer (CPB) loop for LiDAR systems. Even with parasitic resistance changes in the power path, the LDPCC loop ensures a constant ILASER by adjusting the VBUS over a wide range of PRF (maximum 200MHz) to enhance pulse-to-pulse reliability. In addition, with the proposed asynchronous-binary-driver (ABD), the CPB loop optimizes driver speed, and reduces pulse width to 0.9ns. To prevent V BUS  transient, the CPB balances ILASER rise and fall times in tens of nanoseconds.","title":"29.6 A Digital-Type GaN Driver with Current-Pulse-Balancer Technique Achieving Sub-Nanosecond Current Pulse Width for High-Resolution and Dynamic Effective Range LiDAR System"}},{"docId":"917","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Long-range (250m) measurement systems with 3D resolution are highly anticipated for various applications such as automotive, surveillance and robotics systems. Direct time-of-flight (ToF) systems based on CMOS image sensors (CIS) with avalanche photodiodes with the Geiger-mode or single-photon avalanche diodes (SPAD) have been developed for these purposes. One difficulty is to meet practical requirements of long-range (250m) measurement capability together with both lateral and depth resolution. Although indirect-ToF systems based on modulation and phase sensitive detection have fine depth resolution of the order of sub-cm, their full range is limited only to 4m with standard Si-photodiodes [1] and 20m with the gain assist of APD [2]. Direct-ToF systems based on SPAD pixels with time-to-digital converters (TDC) have long range measurement capability but have not reached megapixel resolution [3], [4]. Another direct-ToF of sub-range syntheses (SRS) system, which detects single photons returned from an object located in each sub-range by synchronous gating, was demonstrated to have a long range (250m) measurement capability with high lateral resolution of 10cm. However, it has a depth resolution limited by the width of optical pulse source [5]. In order to circumvent this issue, in this work, we develop an SRS-ToF system based on a 6m pitch, 1200900pixels, Geiger-mode operated vertical avalanche photodiodes (VAPD) CIS that enables one to configure depth resolution down to 10cm for short-distance (<; 20m) ranging by building an indirect-ToF system on the previous one [5], where a capability for long-distance (250m) ranging with a lateral resolution of 10cm is preserved. The full range comprising 15 subranges is measured in real time (30fps) with a 450fps speed of each subrange capture. Charge packets of Geiger-mode pulses accumulated on an in-pixel charge accumulator (ICA) are converted to a precise photon-count-image by a single-slope analog-to-digital converter (SSADC). In addition, by phase differentiating accumulated Geiger-mode charge on the ICA, resolving the near side of a sub-range down to 10cm is demonstrated. Thus, a Geiger-mode ToF system capable of imaging a frame with direct-indirect mixed subranges by a single CIS chip is achieved.","title":"5.2 A 1200900 6m 450fps Geiger-Mode Vertical Avalanche Photodiodes CMOS Image Sensor for a 250m Time-of-Flight Ranging System Using Direct-Indirect-Mixed Frame Synthesis with Configurable-Depth-Resolution Down to 10cm"}},{"docId":"1010","weight":1.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"3D imaging technologies have become prevalent for diverse applications such as user identification, interactive user interfaces with AR\/VR devices, and self-driving cars.

As shown in red in Fig. 5.3.1, the solar irradiance at 940nm is only one-fourth of the case at 850nm, and it keeps going down with increasing wavelength and even vanishes at 1350nm. To further increase the system SNR, using larger laser power is a feasible choice, but this introduces a laser safety issue [4]. The maximum permissible exposure (MPE) at the cornea versus laser wavelength with 0.1s exposure time is plotted in blue in Fig. 5.3.1 as well. Obviously, the exposure limit is quite stringent at 940nm, but much relaxed at a longer near-infrared (NIR) wavelength. Both curves in Fig. 5.3.1 indicate that a better SNR can be achieved with lasers emitting at a longer NIR wavelength, while the system can still satisfy the constraint of MPE.

Recent indirect ToF sensors have achieved continuous improvements in depth performance [1-4]. However, one of the issues with indirect ToF sensors is peak current during exposure time [1,2]. To solve the issue, current spreading can be adopted by driving each column group in a different time point; the resulting column fixed-pattern phase noise (FPPN) is compensated by time-interleaving two opposite-directional delay chains [2]. However, this approach suffers from demodulation contrast (DC) degradation around the edge of the pixel array, by combining two different phase signals at the pixel level [2]. Another issue for indirect ToF sensors is multi-user interference [5]. When multiple ToF cameras with the same modulation frequency shine light onto the same object, the reflected light signals interfere each other, which may distort depth information.

In this context, we develop a UFS 2.0 device that introduces new features to the conventional embedded NAND storage device controller architecture to improve read performance. Figure 19.3.2 shows a block diagram of our controller. We improve the read performance in the following ways: 1) suppress the number of NAND read accesses and reduce the read latency by introducing unified memory (UM) and caching data for address translations on it, 2) increase the number of NAND chips activated simultaneously with dedicated hardware and new command scheduling, and 3) maximize bandwidth by supporting 5.8Gb\/s 2-lane M-PHY link with low-power analog circuits.","title":"19.3 66.3KIOPS-random-read 690MB\/s-sequential-read universal Flash storage device controller with unified memory extension"}},{"docId":"12","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"A wet sensor, which detects the presence or absence of liquid, is an important tool for biomedical, nursing-care, and elderly-care applications such as the detection of blood in bandages, sweat in underwear, and urination in diapers.

Even in digital PLLs, which rely on a digital loop filter, the bandwidth still depends on the gains of two mixed-signal building blocks, namely the time\/digital converter (TDC) and the digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO), that have conversion characteristics that are not well-controlled. The situation is even more cumbersome employing a singlebit TDC, often referred to as bang-bang phase detector (BBPD), where the linearized gain is inversely proportional to the input jitter [1]. An accurate and repeatable value of the PLL bandwidth, and in the general of the frequency response, is essential to meet several specifications, such as stability margin, settling time, jitter and spur level. When the PLL is operated as a direct frequency modulator with pre-emphasis of the modulation signal, the accuracy requirement of the frequency response is even more demanding [2]. Previously disclosed methods to control PLL bandwidth require a modulation signal to be injected into the loop [2], compensate the gain variations of just a single block (e.g., VCO [3] or BBPD [4]), or operate in the foreground [5]. This paper presents a digital PLL employing a digital background normalization of loop gain, which makes it independent of any analog variable (except for the reference frequency, which often is available from an accurate source).

Therefore, it is expected to achieve better performance with lower SRAM V DDMIN . However, the quantized sizing of the channel width and length has drawbacks for conventional 6T-SRAM bitcell scaling. To minimize the bitcell area of the high-density SRAM bitcell, the number of fins (setting the channel width, W) of the pull-up PMOS (PU), passgate NMOS (PG) and pull-down NMOS (PD) transistors must be selected as 1:1:1. Since PU, PG, and PD have the same channel length (L), the ratio in geometry between the PU transistor and the PG transistor is equal to one. With the process variations, the strength of PU transistor can be much stronger than the PG transistor. A stronger PU transistor increases read stability of the SRAM bitcell but it degrades the write margin significantly and results in worse write-V DDMIN  issue. Figure 13.5.1(a) shows a contention condition between PU and PG transistors of a 6T-SRAM bitcell for the write operation. During the write operation, the PU transistor impedes the ability of the PG transistor to pull the storage node (S) from V DD  to ground. The bitcell may suffer a write failure at the stronger PU with weaker PG condition caused by the device variations. Two techniques have been proposed to improve the high density SRAM bitcell write V DDMIN : 1) negative bit-line voltage (NBL) to increase the strength of PG transistor and 2) lower cell V DD  (LCV) to weaken PU transistor strength [1-5].

A global clock requires costly full-chip margining and significant power and area for clock distribution, while synchronizing data FIFOs add power, performance, and area overhead per clock crossing.

Ideally, the TR should be in excess of one octave, since this allows the easy synthesis of all frequencies below those directly generated by the VCOs via repeated frequency divisions by 2.

This is a crucial requirement in modern radios, where there are more PLLs active at the same time, and particularly when (non-contiguous) carrier aggregation is implemented, since in this case the signal bands may be very close to each other. If an individual PLL is used for each band, the VCOs may oscillate very close to each other, or at frequencies that are harmonically related to each other, posing a very serious issue of mutual pulling through the respective magnetic field.

SNR at low-light conditions, which is a key performance metric, is determined by the sensitivity and crosstalk in pixels. To improve sensitivity, pixel technology has migrated from frontside illumination (FSI) to backside illumiation (BSI) as pixel size shrinks down. In BSI technology, it is very difficult to further increase the sensitivity in a pixel of near-1.0m size because there are no structural obstacles for incident light from micro-lens to photodiode. Therefore the only way to improve low-light SNR is to reduce crosstalk, which makes the non-diagonal elements of the color-correction matrix (CCM) close to zero and thus reduces color noise [3]. The best way to improve crosstalk is to introduce a complete physical isolation between neighboring pixels, e.g., using deep-trench isolation (DTI). So far, a few attempts using DTI have been made to suppress silicon crosstalk. A backside DTI in as small as 1.12m-pixel, which is formed in the BSI process, is reported in [4], but it is just an intermediate step in the DTI-related technology because it cannot completely prevent silicon crosstalk, especially for long wavelengths of light. On the other hand, front-side DTIs for FSI pixels [5] and BSI pixels [6] are reported. In [5], however, DTI is present not only along the periphery of each pixel, but also invades into the pixel so that it is inefficient in terms of gathering incident light and providing sufficient amount of photodiode area. In [6], the pixel size is as large as 2.0m and it is hard to scale down with this technology for near 1.0m pitch because DTI width imposes a critical limit on the sufficient amount of photodiode area for full-well capacity. Thus, a new technological advance is necessary to realize the ideal front DTI in a small size pixel near 1.0m.","title":"7.1 A 1\/4-inch 8Mpixel CMOS image sensor with 3D backside-illuminated 1.12m pixel with front-side deep-trench isolation and vertical transfer gate"}},{"docId":"61","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Despite versatility and low power consumption, direct-conversion transmitters suffer from a fundamental drawback: the local oscillator disturbance by the power amplifier, through unwanted electromagnetic or capacitive coupling [1,2].

However, current active matrix OLED (AMOLED) displays on foil do not validate this power-efficient advantage, as too much power is lost in the AM backplane. AMOLED displays use the analog voltage on the gate of a drive transistor (e.g. M1 in Fig. 30.2.1) to control the pixel current and hence the pixel brightness. Accurate and uniform pixel currents can only be obtained when transistor M1 is driven is saturation. In highresolution technologies on foil, transistor parameters W, L and the mobility  are limited by technology, imposing a minimal V GS -V T  to obtain sufficient current, i.e. V GS -V T  > 4V for a-IGZO on foil [1]. Subsequently, to obtain saturation, V DS  > 4V, which translates in a static backplane power loss surpassing the OLED power consumption (see red stars in Fig 30.2.1). However, when the OLED pixel impedance around a specific reference current can be matched along a display column line, the accurate pixel current control can be imposed by current DACs implemented in external silicon display column drivers. In this work, we operate M1 as a switch and pixel intensity variations are obtained using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) of a predefined pixel current, i.e. 2A\/pixel [8080m 2 ] (which corresponds in our OLED technology to a light output of 2000Cd\/m 2 ). When, in a future implementation the external DACs are calibrated at 0.2A\/pixel, the full brightness would correspond to the typical display brightness of a portable PC, i.e. 200Cd\/m 2 . This concept enables us to reduce the display power voltage at full brightness from 8.2V in a classical AMOLED display on foil configuration to 5V (measured) and for future implementations even down to 4V (see Fig. 30.2.1).

First, bulk water has two major relaxation modes: (i) the first mode represents the dielectric relaxation of the cooperative organization of hydrogen-bonded water molecules with a time constant  d  (8ps), and (ii) the second mode exhibits a faster relaxation time constant  f  (0.27ps) and is usually attributed to the rotation of the water molecules that are not involved in hydrogen bonding.

Owing to the presence of  s -mode water, the fractions of  d - and  f -mode waters in biological water are smaller than those in bulk water. In this manner, the existence and status of biological water is reflected in the complex dielectric constant at a frequency around 100GHz. Because the ionic polarization of electrolytes (e.g., Na, K, Ca) strongly affects the dielectric loss in the frequency range lower than 50GHz, a difficulty arises in differentiating the dielectric relaxations of water from that of the ionic polarization [2].

Since PU, PG, and PD have the same channel length (L), the ratio in geometry between the PU transistor and the PG transistor is equal to one. With the process variations, the strength of PU transistor can be much stronger than the PG transistor. A stronger PU transistor increases read stability of the SRAM bitcell but it degrades the write margin significantly and results in worse write-V DDMIN  issue. Figure 13.5.1(a) shows a contention condition between PU and PG transistors of a 6T-SRAM bitcell for the write operation. During the write operation, the PU transistor impedes the ability of the PG transistor to pull the storage node (S) from V DD  to ground. The bitcell may suffer a write failure at the stronger PU with weaker PG condition caused by the device variations. Two techniques have been proposed to improve the high density SRAM bitcell write V DDMIN : 1) negative bit-line voltage (NBL) to increase the strength of PG transistor and 2) lower cell V DD  (LCV) to weaken PU transistor strength [1-5]. Compared to the conventional techniques, this work develops a suppressed-coupling-signal negative bitline (SCS-NBL) scheme and a write-recovery-enhancement lower-cell-V DD  (WRE-LCV) scheme for write assist without the concern of reliability at higher V DD  operating region. A comparison of the effectiveness of the two design techniques is also performed. Figure 13.5.1(b) shows the layout view of the high-density 6T-SRAM bit-cell with 0.07m 2  area in a 16nm high-k metal-gate FinFET technology. To minimize area, we set the geometric ratio of PU, PG, and PD transistors all equal to one. With the two developed write-assist circuits, the overall V DDMIN  improvement can be over 300mV in a 128Mb SRAM test-chip.","title":"13.5 A 16nm 128Mb SRAM in high- metal-gate FinFET technology with write-assist circuitry for low-VMIN applications"}},{"docId":"24","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Energy-efficient networks-on-chip (NoCs) are key enablers for exa-scale computation by shifting power budget from communication toward computation. As core counts scale into the 100s, on-chip interconnect fabrics must support increasing heterogeneity and voltage\/clock domains. Synchronous NoCs require either a single clock distributed globally or clock-crossing data FIFOs between clock domains [1]. A global clock requires costly full-chip margining and significant power and area for clock distribution, while synchronizing data FIFOs add power, performance, and area overhead per clock crossing. Source-synchronous NoCs mitigate these penalties by forwarding a local clock along with each packet, but still suffer from high data storage power due to packet switching.

Ideally, the TR should be in excess of one octave, since this allows the easy synthesis of all frequencies below those directly generated by the VCOs via repeated frequency divisions by 2. At the same time, the oscillation spectrum should be affected as little as possible by spurious (common-mode) magnetic fields impinging on the inductor coil in the VCO tank. This is a crucial requirement in modern radios, where there are more PLLs active at the same time, and particularly when (non-contiguous) carrier aggregation is implemented, since in this case the signal bands may be very close to each other. If an individual PLL is used for each band, the VCOs may oscillate very close to each other, or at frequencies that are harmonically related to each other, posing a very serious issue of mutual pulling through the respective magnetic field.

SNR at low-light conditions, which is a key performance metric, is determined by the sensitivity and crosstalk in pixels. To improve sensitivity, pixel technology has migrated from frontside illumination (FSI) to backside illumiation (BSI) as pixel size shrinks down. In BSI technology, it is very difficult to further increase the sensitivity in a pixel of near-1.0m size because there are no structural obstacles for incident light from micro-lens to photodiode. Therefore the only way to improve low-light SNR is to reduce crosstalk, which makes the non-diagonal elements of the color-correction matrix (CCM) close to zero and thus reduces color noise [3]. The best way to improve crosstalk is to introduce a complete physical isolation between neighboring pixels, e.g., using deep-trench isolation (DTI). So far, a few attempts using DTI have been made to suppress silicon crosstalk. A backside DTI in as small as 1.12m-pixel, which is formed in the BSI process, is reported in [4], but it is just an intermediate step in the DTI-related technology because it cannot completely prevent silicon crosstalk, especially for long wavelengths of light. On the other hand, front-side DTIs for FSI pixels [5] and BSI pixels [6] are reported. In [5], however, DTI is present not only along the periphery of each pixel, but also invades into the pixel so that it is inefficient in terms of gathering incident light and providing sufficient amount of photodiode area. In [6], the pixel size is as large as 2.0m and it is hard to scale down with this technology for near 1.0m pitch because DTI width imposes a critical limit on the sufficient amount of photodiode area for full-well capacity. Thus, a new technological advance is necessary to realize the ideal front DTI in a small size pixel near 1.0m.","title":"7.1 A 1\/4-inch 8Mpixel CMOS image sensor with 3D backside-illuminated 1.12m pixel with front-side deep-trench isolation and vertical transfer gate"}},{"docId":"61","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Despite versatility and low power consumption, direct-conversion transmitters suffer from a fundamental drawback: the local oscillator disturbance by the power amplifier, through unwanted electromagnetic or capacitive coupling [1,2].

However, current active matrix OLED (AMOLED) displays on foil do not validate this power-efficient advantage, as too much power is lost in the AM backplane. AMOLED displays use the analog voltage on the gate of a drive transistor (e.g. M1 in Fig. 30.2.1) to control the pixel current and hence the pixel brightness. Accurate and uniform pixel currents can only be obtained when transistor M1 is driven is saturation. In highresolution technologies on foil, transistor parameters W, L and the mobility  are limited by technology, imposing a minimal V GS -V T  to obtain sufficient current, i.e. V GS -V T  > 4V for a-IGZO on foil [1]. Subsequently, to obtain saturation, V DS  > 4V, which translates in a static backplane power loss surpassing the OLED power consumption (see red stars in Fig 30.2.1). However, when the OLED pixel impedance around a specific reference current can be matched along a display column line, the accurate pixel current control can be imposed by current DACs implemented in external silicon display column drivers. In this work, we operate M1 as a switch and pixel intensity variations are obtained using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) of a predefined pixel current, i.e. 2A\/pixel [8080m 2 ] (which corresponds in our OLED technology to a light output of 2000Cd\/m 2 ). When, in a future implementation the external DACs are calibrated at 0.2A\/pixel, the full brightness would correspond to the typical display brightness of a portable PC, i.e. 200Cd\/m 2 . This concept enables us to reduce the display power voltage at full brightness from 8.2V in a classical AMOLED display on foil configuration to 5V (measured) and for future implementations even down to 4V (see Fig. 30.2.1). As the OLED current load remains equal, a corresponding static power reduction of the display (and increased battery lifetime) is obtained. Digital driving methods of AMOLED displays have been shown before. However,  techniques [2] still integrate charge packets on the gate of M1 and hence do not solve the power issue on foil. Other PWM techniques [3] activate only a single active line in the linedriver yielding difficulties to obtain color depths above 6 bits. When multiple independent linedrivers are implemented and their output is multiplexed to alternately drive a single select line, a higher color depth can be obtained [4].

Binary DNNs [5-6] are used to reduce computation and hardware costs for AI edge devices; however, a memory bottleneck still remains. In Fig. 31.5.1 conventional PE arrays exploit parallelized computation, but suffer from inefficient single-row SRAM access to weights and intermediate data. Computing-in-memory (CIM) improves efficiency by enabling parallel computing, reducing memory accesses, and suppressing intermediate data.

To conserve system energy, high-power devices stay dormant and are woken up only when an event is detected by a low-power always-on detector: which can be implemented by analog compute in memory (ACIM). However, there is a tradeoff between the inference accuracy and analog nonideality for ACIM designs, limiting the applicable AIoT applications. Current-domain [1] and time-domain [2] MACs show attractive energy efficiency since the area and parasitic capacitance are minimized from the compactly arranged unit cells. However, due to the large mismatch and nonlinearity of the unit cell, overall linearity is limited and is sensitive to PVT. The charge-sharing MAC [3] achieves PVT-insensitive linear 1bIN 1bW accumulation. However, expanding the IN and W precision from multiple 1bIN 1bW MACs and digital bit shifting which is also known as bit-wise causes large INL and noise discontinuities, due to a lack of inter-MSB\/LSB conversion's error correction margin. Besides, energy consumption is multiplied by reusing the 1b hardware. To overcome random noise, this work implements an error desensitization algorithm by training the VWW detector with the ACIM noise model. When the noise-aware error desensitization algorithm is used in a visual-wake-word (VWW) detector, the noise requirement for ACIM is relaxed by  2 , while still achieving the same inference accuracy.

Unlike CNN-only networks, however, recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) models consist of multiple blocks of various layers with different layer-by-layer characteristics in sparsity and required precision. This trend presents challenges in building a general accelerator architecture to maximize the benefits from sparsity and quantization, while supporting efficient processing for various models ranging from traditional CNNs to the new models to come in the future. First, there are multiple considerations that include the bottleneck in data bandwidth, as well as the trade-off between sparsity and required precision. The required precision is likely to increase as the sparsity increases. This underpins the need for flexibility in setting the quantization with a layer-by-layer configuration. In addition, storing data in a unified format can also prohibit the maximum utilization of hardware resources. Since recent models have large variations in sparsity [11], a major portion of data movement might be taken by sending zeros, causing a severe waste in data bandwidth. We propose a sparsity-aware accelerator that adaptively changes the data format by detecting the sparsity of the given task. Data is stored in raw format when the sparse rate is low and in compressed format (run-length coding, RLC) when the sparse rate is high. Second, there is a correlation between the effective precision and the quantization policy. Arbitrary quantization has demonstrated a higher level of quality of result (QoR) compared to linear quantization (denoted as INT). There have been two representative approaches in nonlinear quantization: 1) arbitrary basis (AB) where quantized values are given by linear combinations of  n  independent bases, and 2) arbitrary quantization (AQ) which has arbitrary 2 quantized values. Though these quantization schemes achieve good accuracy, there has been no hardware implementation for efficient processing of AQ. The conventional INT multiplication increases the complexity by 4x as both input precisions double. On the other hand, if AQ with a scalable precision of up to 8b is implemented using a look-up-table (LUT) approach, it would explode hardware complexity. To resolve this problem, we propose a hierarchical decoding architecture for AQ with a scalable precision up to 8b. Finally, the required precisions for inputs and weights are not the same [4], [10]. Good QoR is realized by assigning more bits to inputs and fewer bits to weights. Previous accelerators handle inputs and weights with a fixed and equal precision leading to the waste of computational energy. This work employs a dynamic-precision bit-serial multiplication for the weights to minimize waste of energy. Putting them all together, we propose a 1-to-8b scalable-precision general-purpose deep learning accelerator to support multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations with input and weight vectors quantized by AQ and AB, respectively. The accelerator includes three main features: 1) a zero elimination scheme that works with two data formats, raw and RLC, to save storage cost and to improve effective bandwidth, 2) extended-precision AQ computing hardware without exploding logic complexity, and 3) bit-serial AB processing without unnecessary computations.","title":"A 127.8TOPS\/W Arbitrarily Quantized 1-to-8b Scalable-Precision Accelerator for General-Purpose Deep Learning with Reduction of Storage, Logic and Latency Waste"}},{"docId":"848","weight":0.3853776308656828,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Convolutional neural networks (CNN) achieve state-of-the-art results in the field of visual perception, drastically changing the traditional computer-vision framework.

A solution to this problem is to use a filter upfront to attenuate interferers. Alternatively [1], the filter can be moved into the CTDSM loop. In [1], a 1 st -order RC filter was used to tame the STF peak of a cascade of integrators with feedforward summation (CIFF) DSM. Apart from the limited selectivity offered by a 1 st -order filter, an active feedback path was necessary to stabilize the loop. The CTDSM in our work obtains an STF with a sharper transition band and a lower cutoff frequency (normalized to the desired signal bandwidth) compared to [1], with the aim of more effectively attenuating close-in interferers. This is realized by embedding a 2 nd -order active filter into the CTDSM. We show that this has the same functionality as the filter upfront, but achieves better linearity (for the same noise and power dissipation) when compared to the filter-CTDSM cascade. Further, no extra active circuitry is necessary to stabilize the loop.

For a transmitter to implement instantaneous bandwidth covering all communication bands while maintaining sufficient dynamic range is usually not cost efficient, and a direct-digital RF modulator (DDRM) with tunable operational band is a potential solution, providing better implementation tradeoff [1]-[4].

Even in digital PLLs, which rely on a digital loop filter, the bandwidth still depends on the gains of two mixed-signal building blocks, namely the time\/digital converter (TDC) and the digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO), that have conversion characteristics that are not well-controlled. The situation is even more cumbersome employing a singlebit TDC, often referred to as bang-bang phase detector (BBPD), where the linearized gain is inversely proportional to the input jitter [1]. An accurate and repeatable value of the PLL bandwidth, and in the general of the frequency response, is essential to meet several specifications, such as stability margin, settling time, jitter and spur level. When the PLL is operated as a direct frequency modulator with pre-emphasis of the modulation signal, the accuracy requirement of the frequency response is even more demanding [2].

To minimize the bitcell area of the high-density SRAM bitcell, the number of fins (setting the channel width, W) of the pull-up PMOS (PU), passgate NMOS (PG) and pull-down NMOS (PD) transistors must be selected as 1:1:1. Since PU, PG, and PD have the same channel length (L), the ratio in geometry between the PU transistor and the PG transistor is equal to one. With the process variations, the strength of PU transistor can be much stronger than the PG transistor. A stronger PU transistor increases read stability of the SRAM bitcell but it degrades the write margin significantly and results in worse write-V DDMIN  issue. Figure 13.5.1(a) shows a contention condition between PU and PG transistors of a 6T-SRAM bitcell for the write operation. During the write operation, the PU transistor impedes the ability of the PG transistor to pull the storage node (S) from V DD  to ground. The bitcell may suffer a write failure at the stronger PU with weaker PG condition caused by the device variations. Two techniques have been proposed to improve the high density SRAM bitcell write V DDMIN : 1) negative bit-line voltage (NBL) to increase the strength of PG transistor and 2) lower cell V DD  (LCV) to weaken PU transistor strength [1-5].

Ideally, the TR should be in excess of one octave, since this allows the easy synthesis of all frequencies below those directly generated by the VCOs via repeated frequency divisions by 2. At the same time, the oscillation spectrum should be affected as little as possible by spurious (common-mode) magnetic fields impinging on the inductor coil in the VCO tank. This is a crucial requirement in modern radios, where there are more PLLs active at the same time, and particularly when (non-contiguous) carrier aggregation is implemented, since in this case the signal bands may be very close to each other. If an individual PLL is used for each band, the VCOs may oscillate very close to each other, or at frequencies that are harmonically related to each other, posing a very serious issue of mutual pulling through the respective magnetic field. And even if a single VCO is used [2], or two (or more) VCOs that are not harmonically related [3], it is nevertheless a good practice to design the tank inductor as insensitive as possible to external magnetic fields, which abound in and close to the radio IC.","title":"21.6 A 2.4-to-5.3GHz dual-core CMOS VCO with concentric 8-shaped coils"}},{"docId":"56","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Since the invention of radio, superheterodyne has been the architecture of choice for receivers (RX).

SNR at low-light conditions, which is a key performance metric, is determined by the sensitivity and crosstalk in pixels. To improve sensitivity, pixel technology has migrated from frontside illumination (FSI) to backside illumiation (BSI) as pixel size shrinks down. In BSI technology, it is very difficult to further increase the sensitivity in a pixel of near-1.0m size because there are no structural obstacles for incident light from micro-lens to photodiode. Therefore the only way to improve low-light SNR is to reduce crosstalk, which makes the non-diagonal elements of the color-correction matrix (CCM) close to zero and thus reduces color noise [3]. The best way to improve crosstalk is to introduce a complete physical isolation between neighboring pixels, e.g., using deep-trench isolation (DTI). So far, a few attempts using DTI have been made to suppress silicon crosstalk. A backside DTI in as small as 1.12m-pixel, which is formed in the BSI process, is reported in [4], but it is just an intermediate step in the DTI-related technology because it cannot completely prevent silicon crosstalk, especially for long wavelengths of light. On the other hand, front-side DTIs for FSI pixels [5] and BSI pixels [6] are reported. In [5], however, DTI is present not only along the periphery of each pixel, but also invades into the pixel so that it is inefficient in terms of gathering incident light and providing sufficient amount of photodiode area. In [6], the pixel size is as large as 2.0m and it is hard to scale down with this technology for near 1.0m pitch because DTI width imposes a critical limit on the sufficient amount of photodiode area for full-well capacity. Thus, a new technological advance is necessary to realize the ideal front DTI in a small size pixel near 1.0m.","title":"7.1 A 1\/4-inch 8Mpixel CMOS image sensor with 3D backside-illuminated 1.12m pixel with front-side deep-trench isolation and vertical transfer gate"}},{"docId":"61","weight":0.0,"docData":{"wordCount":"10","abstract":"Despite versatility and low power consumption, direct-conversion transmitters suffer from a fundamental drawback: the local oscillator disturbance by the power amplifier, through unwanted electromagnetic or capacitive coupling [1,2].

To alleviate this, time-consuming and often unpredictable optimization of the floor plan, package, and PCB is required to maximize the isolation between the PA and VCO. Ultimately, this issue may prohibit the use of this architecture for many applications, leading to higher power consumption.
